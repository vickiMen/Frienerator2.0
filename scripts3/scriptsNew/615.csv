Which means that the first part of this episode is episode 615. The second part of this episode is episode 616. Since episodes 615 and 616 are combined into one file, that’s why there is no episode 616 in the season 6 table of contents and the numbers jump from episode 615 to 617.} Hey, you guys! Guess what? Barry and Mindy are getting a divorce! Oh my God! Wow!  What is the matter with you?! No! Barry and Mindy. Oh sorry, I hear divorce I immediately go to Ross.  Who-who’s Barry and Mindy? Barry was the guy that I was almost married and Mindy was my best friend. Ohh-oh, wasn’t he cheating on you with her? Yeah, but that just means that he was falling asleep on top of her instead of me. Why did they get divorced? Well, apparently she caught him cheating on her with someone else. Isn’t that sad?  God, could you imagine if I actually married him?! I mean how different would my life be? I know what you mean, I’ve always wondered how different my life would be if-if I’d never gotten divorced. Which time? The first time! No seriously, imagine if Carol hadn’t realized she was a lesbian.  I can’t. I keep seeing it the good way. I’d bet I’d still be doing my kara-tay.  Towards the end of our marriage I was doing a lot of kara-tay as a way of releasing the tension from y’know, not doing anything else physical. Maybe the problem was you were pronouncing it kara-tay. And what if I was still fat?  Well, you wouldn’t be dating me, that’s for sure. Sure I would!  Oh yeah! Come on! Yeah right! What, you guys really think that I’m that shallow? No, I just think Monica was that fat. Hey, imagine if I never got fired off Days Of Our Lives!  Oh-hey, there’s Carol again! What if I had had the guts to quit my job? I’d probably be writing for the New Yorker, getting paid to be funny. But my job’s fun too! I mean tomorrow, I-I don’t have to wear a tie. What if I had taken that job at Merrill Lynch? What?! Merrill Lynch? Yeah, I had a massage client who worked there and-and he said I had a knack for stocks. Well why didn’t you take the job? Because at that time you see, I thought everything that rhymed was true. So I thought y’know that if I’d work with stocks, I’d have to live in a box, and only eat lox, and have a pet fox. Hey, do you guys think that if all those things happened, we’d still hang out?{Transcriber’s note: This is where the opening credits are, but they’re not the usual opening credits. Oh no! These credits are based on the world that would have been created had all of the above actually happened. It starts out with all of them at the fountain sitting on the couch as Fat Monica runs up and sits on the arm of the couch, tilting the whole thing towards her. It then goes on to show Rachel’s still a shop-aholic and with Barry. Fat Monica is sweating while cooking and dancing while eating a donut. Phoebe as the Wall Street shark smoking while on two cell phones. Then they’re dancing in the fountain. Joey entering as Dr. Drake Remoray and meeting a groupie. Chandler trying to write as a bird does its business on his shoulder and falling asleep while typing. Ross doing some kara-tay and trying to get Carol into bed. And finally, some more dancing in the fountain, them all flexing, and the turning out the lamp and shutting off all the lights bit from the first season. Just remember one thing, this is an alternate universe. Everything from every other episode doesn’t apply, for instance, Ross and Rachel have no history. And in fact have not seen each other in years in this world.}  Oh my God! Rachel Green?  Rob Tillman! No-no. It’s-it’s me, Ross! Oh, I’m sorry. Ross Tillman. No, no-no, Ross Geller. Ohh, of course Monica’s brother! Yeah. Right. Wow! How are you?! Good-good, I’m-I’m married.  Ohh! Me too! Is-isn’t it the best? Oh, it’s the best!  So, umm how’s Monica? Oh really, really great! Yeah! A-actually she’s right down the street, umm, do-do you know what? You should stop bye and say hi. Ohh, I would love too. Yeah? Oh-oh, she’d be so excited! Ohh! Okay! Come on!  Oh wait, don’t you have to pay for your,  Busty Ladies? No, it’s okay. Some-some kid asked me to pick it up for him, but I don’t…  Oh yeah? Okay.  Okay. But! Don’t you have to give him his money back? Uh-huh.  Okay, let’s go see Monica! So Monica, still going out with Dr. Boring huh? He’s not boring! He’s just-he’s just low key.Monica's   Thanks.Monica's  Yeah. Y’know, the hazelnut actually not a nut, it’s a seed.  Wow!!Monica's  Can anyone else name a well known seed that’s been masquerading as a nut? Oh dear God, let me think.   Hey. Hey. Oh no! What’s the matter? Oh I just got another rejection letter. They said my writing was funny, just not \"Archie Comic funny.\"Monica's  Y’know what honey? I got to get back to the hospital. Okay.Monica's   Okay. Bye.Monica's  Bye-bye.  Was his question what’s more boring than him? Hey man, look sorry about that Archie thing. Do uh, do you need me to give you some money? Hey, I may have no money, but I still have my pride. Really? Ehh. Maybe Joey doesn’t have to give you the money, TV stars have assistants right? That’s an idea!  Hey, if I hired an assistant, would-would you take money from her? No Joey! Chandler could be your assistant! See, he could answer all of your fan mail and stuff! That’s great! That would be great! Let’s do that! I could use the money; it could give me time to write. Oh right great! Welcome aboard! Okay! All right! Now hey, I need to use the bathroom. Since I don’t need any assistance in there, take a break! All right!  Hey! Hey Phoebe! Guess what? What? Joey just hired Chandler to be his assistant! Ohh that’s so sweet!  Go!! No! No-no! I said sell when it hits 50! 5-0, it’s a number! It comes after 4-9!! No, it’s okay. It’s okay, you’re allowed one mistake. Just kidding, you are of course fired. Hey Mon! Hey! Mon, look who I ran into!   You look terrific! Ohh, so do you! Did you lose weight?  You are so sweet to notice! Yes, I lost three and a half pounds! And, and uh, you-you remember my friend Chandler.  Hey. Oh yeah. And that’s Phoebe over there!  Hi! Oh my God, sit down! Sit down! How long as it been since we’ve seen each other?  1987, the day after Christmas, at Sean McMahon’s party. I played you one of my songs, y’know Interplanetary Courtship Ritual. Oh yeah. Right. So now, are—do you, do you still do music? Sometimes, you should come over  sometime! I’ll play you one of my other…  Oh my God! Joey Tribbiani from Days of Our Lives, just walked in here! Rach, he’s a friend of ours.  You are friends with Dr. Drake Remoray? Well it’s kinda hard to be friends with Drake because of his busy schedule and the fact that he’s not real.  Hey-hey, or I could bring my keyboard over here sometime! He’s coming over! He’s coming over!  Joey!  Ohhh!  No! This is my friend Rachel, we went to High School together.  Hi!  Hi!  Hi! I love you on that show! I watch you everyday! I mean, when you took out your own kidney to save your ex-wife even though she tired to kill you… Well, it’s always nice to meet the fans. Ah!  She’s not crazy is she? No.  So uh, how you doin’? Hang on! Hang on! Hang on!  What kind of name is Brendy? I… Whatever… Stop talking! All right, from now on your name is Joan. You can pick your own last name.  Hey there you are! Uh-oh, it’s my boss! All right, here’s a list of things for you to do today. Man, this going to be so great! Thank you so much! All right, I got to go to work I’m delivering twins today, but only one of them is mine!   Drop off my dry cleaning. Pick up my vitamins. Teach me how to spell vitamins. Wear in my new jeans.  You realize what you are don’t you? What? You’re his bitch.  No-no!! No!!  Oh wait! You didn’t just sit on my Kit-Kats did you?!! No! There-there was a little, a little diff in the market and I lost 13 million dollars. But the Kit-Kats are all right?! What am I gonna do?! What am I gonna do?! I can’t call my office they’ll kill me! I can’t call my clients they’ll kill themselves! Great, now my chest hearts. What?!  My chest hurts! Oh, and now I-I can’t breathe. Phoebe, are you having a heart attack?! Oh, if I were, would-would I have shooting pains up and down my left arm? Yes!! Then yes that is what I’m having.  Oh my God! Come on Pheebs, it’s not that bad! Y’know most people would be excited if they didn’t have to work for a couple of weeks. Most people don’t like their jobs, I love my job! I have not been working for three hours and I’m already going crazy. I miss Joan. Honey, having a heart attack is nature’s way of telling you to slow it down. I always thought having a heart attack was nature’s way of telling you to die!  But you’re not gonna die. I mean, you are going to die, but you’re not gonna die today. I wish I was dead. Let’s take a walk.   So what’s going on with you? Well umm, I’ve been doing a lot more of my kara-tay. Still going through that dry spell with Carol? Yeah. How long has it been since you had sex? Well, last weekend… Oh that’s not so bad. …will be two months… That is. …since I stopped trying. Maybe you need to spice things up a little. What-what do you mean? I don’t know. You could tie her up, she could tie you up; you could eat stuff off each other… Oh. Y’know, dirty talk, m�nage � trois, toys… Wow! Roll playing… You could be the warden; she could be the prisoner. You could be the pirate; she could be the wench! Okay, I think I got it. Yeah! Or too, you could be two stockbrokers and you’re-you’re-you’re rolling around naked on the trading floor and everybody’s watching!  It never happened. Sorry. So how’s it going with Joey? Oh just great. He beeps me now with codes. One is, \"Bring me food.\" Two is, \"I’m with a girl, bring us food.\" Three is, \"I’m lost and I can’t find food.\"  Hey! Is uh, is she gonna be all right? Yeah! She’s right in there!  Oh great.  Hey! Go take off those pants, they look ready! All right, and over there is Brady’s Pub where I like to unwind after a long day of surgeoning. Wow! This is so amazing! What else? What else? Well, that is a large piece of television equipment.  And uh that is an old man! Hey old man! Hey! All righty, what do you say we head back to my place?  Wow! Umm, y’know, I-I would really love to, but I-I shouldn’t. Why?  Why can’t the world stop turning, just for a moment? Just for us?  Isn’t that a line from the show?! Uh, yeah but uh,  I may have said those things before but, I never truly meant them. Until now. That’s a line from the show too! Okay, you watch too much TV.  Thanks!  Yeah? I thought we talked about this. I don’t like pulp. No pulp. Pulp isn’t juice. All juice, okay? I’m sorry, I guess I just like the pulp. Oh my God, I’m sorry, I’m being so rude.  Rachel, would like a soda or something? Because Chandler would run right out and get it. Yeah sure, iced tea would be great.  Iced tea. Okay, anything for you sir?  Did I not just tell him?  Yes, you did.  You’re gonna throw that juice at me, aren’t ya? It’s not all juice!  So honey, this morning was fun, huh? Me hopping in on you in the shower there. Yeah! And maybe someday we could get a place with two bathrooms. Look Carol umm, I was, I was thinking maybe uh, maybe we can spice things up a little. What do you mean? Carol our sex life is—it’s just not working…  Hey there little fella! Hey, uh-hey, why don’t we get some shoes on ya, huh? Hey, why don’t you show dad how you can put your shoes on, in your room! Yay!! Yay!  Yay!  Seriously, our sex life… I was thinking, maybe I don’t know, we could try some-some new things. Y’know? For fun? Like what? Well I don’t know umm,  Umm, we could, we could have a threesome.  I love that idea! Who sold a story to Archie Comics?! Oh my God! That’s great! Oh wow!  You’re a published writer! I wish I had a present for you! Aww. Wait a minute!  My last Kit-Kat bar! You wanna share it? Okay!!  Hey! Hey Chandler look, I know you’re mad, but I just want to say I’m sorry. I-I was a total jerk. Completely o-over the line. Uh, I just I hate pulp! Y’know? I mean, y’know how Monica feels about low fat mayonnaise? It’s not mayonnaise!! Yeah, o-o-o-o-okay anyway, I just wanted to say I’m sorry. Here.  What’s this? Fresh squeezed orange juice, with pulp! Just the way you like it. Aww, thanks man.  Hey Joey, Chandler sold a story to Archie Comics! Oh my God! That’s great! Congratulations! What’s the story?! Oh you wouldn’t uh, care. It’s just a stupid comic book story. Are you kidding me?! I love Archie! And the whole gang! Well uh, Archie needs money to fix his jalopy , uh but he doesn’t want Reggie to just give him the money. So Reggie hires him as his assist—as his butler. And then makes him do all these crazy things like bring him milkshakes that can’t have lumps in them. Wait a minute. That sounds a little familiar! Did they already do that one? ‘Cause I think I read it! Oh Mon, listen I have to ask! Okay, Joey Tribbiani invited me back to his apartment, now does he do this with a lot of girls? Yeah, a lot. A lot, a lot! Ohh! And I’m one of them!! Wow! Oh, I just cannot believe this! I mean, Joey Tribbiani! Well, y’know it’s none of my business, but aren’t you married? Yeah.
