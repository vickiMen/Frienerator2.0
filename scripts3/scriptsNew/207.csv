PHOE: Hey Joey.JOEY: Hey Phoebs.PHOE: How come you're watching a rabbi play electric guitar?JOEY: I can't find the remote.  Thank you.PHOE: So, Scott asked me to come over for lunch today and I did.JOEY: And?PHOE: And we did.JOEY: All right Phoebs, way to go.PHOE: Yay me.JOEY: So, so how did it happen?PHOE: Well, I finally took your advice and asked him what was going on.JOEY: And what did he say?PHOE: He said that, um, he understands how sex can be like, a very emotional thing for a woman and he was just afraid that I was gonna get all, y'know, like, 'ohh, is he gonna call me the next day' and, y'know, 'where is this going' and, ya know, blah-la-la-la-la. So he said he wanted to hold off until he was prepared to be really serious.JOEY: Wow.PHOE: Yeah, so I said, \"OK, relax please,\" y'know, I mean, sex can be just about two people right there in the moment, y'know, it's, if he wants to see me again he can call and if not, that's fine too. So after a looooot of talking. . . I convinced him.JOEY: Let me get this straight. He got you to beg to sleep with him, he got you to say he never has to call you again, and he got you thinking this was a great idea.PHOE: Um-hum.JOEY: This man is my God.RACH: Hi.ROSS: I didn't get a cat.RACH: Oh, that's um, interesting.ROSS: No, no it's not interesting. OK, it's very, very not interesting. In fact it's actually 100 percent completely opposite of interesting.RACH: Alright, I got it Ross.ROSS: You had no right to tell me you ever had feelings for me.RACH:  What?ROSS: I was doing great with Julie before I found out about you.RACH: Hey, I was doin' great before I found out about you. You think it's easy for me to see you with Julie?ROSS: Then you should have said something before I met her.RACH: I didn't know then. And how come you never said anything to me.ROSS: There was never a good time.RACH: Right, you, you only had a year. We only hung out every night.ROSS: Not, not, not every night. You know, and... and it's not like I didn't try, Rachel, but things got in the way, y'know? Like, like Italian guys or ex-fiances or, or, or Italian guys.RACH: Hey, there was one Italian guy, OK, and do you even have a point?ROSS: The point is I... I don't need this right now, OK. It, it's too late, I'm with somebody else, I'm happy. This ship has sailed.RACH: Yeah, what're you saying, you just sort of put away feelings or whatever the hell it was you felt for me?ROSS: Hey, I've been doin' it since the ninth grade, I've gotten pretty damn good at it.RACH: Alright, fine, you go ahead and you do that, alright Ross.ROSS: Fine.RACH: 'Cause I don't need your stupid ship.ROSS: Good.RACH: Good. RACH: And ya know what, now I've got closure.ROSS: Try the bottom one.CLOSING CREDITS CHAN: Monica, it's 6:30 in the morning. We're not working out, it's over.MNCA: No way, with one pound to go, c'mon. We're workin', we're movin', we're in the zone we're groovin'.CHAN: OK, I don't, I don't mind the last pound. OK, in fact I kind of like the last pound. OK, so don't make me do anything that I'll regret.MNCA: Ooh, what'cha gonna do, fat boy, huh? What?CHAN: Nothing, except tell you, uh, I think it's wonderful how much energy you have.MNCA: Well, thanks.CHAN: I mean, especially considering how tough it's been for you to find work.MNCA: Well, you know.CHAN: You know, I mean, you can't tell your parents you were fired because they'd be disappointed.MNCA:  Uh-huh.CHAN: And it's not as if you have a boyfriend's shoulder to cry on.MNCA: Well no, but um.CHAN: I mean, if it were me, I think I'd have difficulty just getting out of bed at all.MNCA: Y'know, I try to stay positive. . .CHAN: So, you feel like goin' for a run?MNCA: Alright.CHAN: Because, you know, you don't have to. If you want, you could just take a nap right here.MNCA: OK. Just for a little while.CHAN: OK. ENDcontrl08.gif ","videoIds":[]}
