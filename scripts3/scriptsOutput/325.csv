KunerthTeleplay by: Adam Chase  So ah, your first sexual experience was with a woman?! All right, I was 15, it was my best friend, Ruth, and we got drunk on that hard cider, and then suddenly, I don’t know, we were, we were making out. Tell it again.  Seriously.  I mean is that woman capable of talking about anything else but sex? Yeah, sure. Well y'know, earlier she was talking about geography. Joey, she was listing the countries she’s done it in. Well, I think we all learned something.  That’s my Mom’s writing! Look.  Me and Frank and Phoebe, Graduation 1965. Y'know what that means? That you’re actually 50? No-no, that’s not, that’s not me Phoebe, that’s her pal Phoebe. According to her high school yearbook, they were like B.F.F.  Best Friends Forever. Oh! That is so cool. I know! So this woman probably could like have all kinds of stories about my parents, and she might even know like where my Dad is. So I looked her up, and she lives out by the beach. So maybe this weekend we could go to the beach? Yeah! Yeah, we can!  Shoot! I can’t go, I have to work! That’s too bad.  Ohh, big, fat bummerrr. So great! Okay! Tomorrow we’re gonna drive out to Montauk. Hey, Bonnie had sex there!  Would you look at them. Am I ever gonna find a boyfriend again? I gonna die an old maid.

So I laughed. Ha-ha-ha. A little to hard. What am I not ah, boyfriend material? Well, no. You’re Chandler. Y'know, Chandler!  Okay, so we’ve established my name, and hit me. But theoretically y'know, I mean say we weren’t friends, say it’s a blind date. I show up at your door, and I’m like  “Hey, nice to meet, ya.
