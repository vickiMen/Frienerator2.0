00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.375
It's finally summer!

00:00:05.458 --> 00:00:08.625
I want to see who can climb a tree
the highest without getting scared,

00:00:08.708 --> 00:00:12.750
and ride a roller coaster
with my hands up, and do a cannonball!

00:00:12.833 --> 00:00:15.958
-Lots to do! Chop-chop!
-You heard the man. Let's get chopping!

00:00:16.042 --> 00:00:19.708
Guys, we can't go. We have to update
all our company files.

00:00:20.875 --> 00:00:23.458
It's going to take forever.

00:00:23.542 --> 00:00:26.625
What? No!
Don't do that on the first day of summer!

00:00:26.708 --> 00:00:29.542
-Hmm.
-No way. We've been down that road.

00:00:29.625 --> 00:00:32.500
[sighs] This has been a long time coming.
Sorry, Ginger.

00:00:32.583 --> 00:00:36.458
Fine! Then I'll have summer fun
some other way!

00:00:36.542 --> 00:00:39.583
-[door slams]
-Wow. Ginger gave up easier than usual.

00:00:39.667 --> 00:00:42.292
Well, the kid knows a lost cause
when he sees one.

00:00:42.375 --> 00:00:45.958
Oh, cheer up! Today could bring
our company big money!

00:00:46.042 --> 00:00:50.667
We could find plans for an app we forgot,
or an old receipt, or even phone numbers!

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.375
Yeah, Ben. This is really exciting.

00:00:54.458 --> 00:00:58.542
Old paper, old bill, treasure map,
old receipt--

00:00:58.625 --> 00:01:00.833
-Wait, treasure map?
-[gasp]

00:01:00.917 --> 00:01:02.875
-Ooh...
-[ker-chink]

00:01:08.125 --> 00:01:09.292
â™ª Wa-oah â™ª

00:01:18.292 --> 00:01:21.500
Why was a treasure map
mixed in with your company's old files?

00:01:21.583 --> 00:01:25.083
I don't know why it's here. These files
were here before we even moved in.

00:01:25.167 --> 00:01:27.250
Well, you know what they say
about treasure maps.

00:01:27.333 --> 00:01:29.458
"Where there's treasure maps,
there's treasure!"

00:01:29.542 --> 00:01:30.792
Hmm.

00:01:31.583 --> 00:01:32.625
Hm.

00:01:32.708 --> 00:01:34.333
Mm-hm.

00:01:34.417 --> 00:01:37.125
-[honk]
-Oh, no you don't!

00:01:37.208 --> 00:01:40.333
You're not postponing
our company organization day!

00:01:40.417 --> 00:01:43.542
Look, we're only going through
all these files to get money.

00:01:43.625 --> 00:01:46.875
Well, let's just find a big pile of it
buried in the ground somewhere, right?

00:01:46.958 --> 00:01:51.458
Wait! You're not trying to take the map
for yourself, are you?

00:01:51.542 --> 00:01:55.333
No! I'm just saying we don't even know
if the map is real!

00:01:55.417 --> 00:01:59.250
But if you did have a treasure adventure,
you'd include me of course, right?

00:01:59.333 --> 00:02:02.833
Yeah, I'd better keep you close -
so I can keep my eyes on you.

00:02:02.917 --> 00:02:05.833
-Oh, really?
-Hey! Hm.

00:02:05.917 --> 00:02:08.292
The treasure is already
making you paranoid.

00:02:09.542 --> 00:02:11.750
No one cheat me out of my share!

00:02:11.833 --> 00:02:13.042
[all murmur]

00:02:13.625 --> 00:02:15.458
Sorry, I dropped one of my floaties--

00:02:16.458 --> 00:02:18.417
-Um.
-Is that a treasure map?

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:20.083
Uh...

00:02:20.167 --> 00:02:22.042
You kicked me out of here to do work

00:02:22.125 --> 00:02:24.625
when really you were all going
on a treasure quest!

00:02:24.708 --> 00:02:28.292
-Uh, Ben?
-Fine. We'll all go.

00:02:28.375 --> 00:02:31.167
-Yay!
-Okay everybody. Let's do this.

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:33.750
-[all murmur]
-[Hank] My treasure.

00:02:36.167 --> 00:02:40.333
I'd say the map is telling us
to check the top of this tree.

00:02:40.417 --> 00:02:43.500
-That was easy.
-Let's get up there!

00:02:43.583 --> 00:02:46.542
-Yay!
-Remember to tell us what you see!

00:02:46.625 --> 00:02:48.833
Don't keep it all to yourself!

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:52.667
You know what?
I'd better go with him just--

00:02:53.333 --> 00:02:54.625
Hey!

00:02:59.333 --> 00:03:02.292
I wonder if one of us should've
stayed down there as a lookout.

00:03:02.375 --> 00:03:05.625
-Look out for what?
-[Darren] Aloha!

00:03:05.708 --> 00:03:08.000
-Ah? Darren?
-Well, now!

00:03:08.083 --> 00:03:13.500
I don't usually see this on my daily
brisk-walk. What are you up to?

00:03:13.583 --> 00:03:14.958
Pff. Nothing!

00:03:15.042 --> 00:03:17.958
But you're acting so suspicious.

00:03:18.042 --> 00:03:20.667
I'm understandably intrigued.

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:25.792
Uh, you can't climb a tree
and act suspicious, right guys?

00:03:25.875 --> 00:03:28.000
-Uh, I mean...
-[suspicious laughter]

00:03:28.083 --> 00:03:31.625
Fine. Enjoy doing whatever people do

00:03:31.708 --> 00:03:34.167
when they don't have
an indoor SCUBA tank at home.

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:37.167
-Phew. We have to be more careful.
-[Ginger] Aaaaah!

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:41.375
I knew I'd be the fastest climber!
And I found this!

00:03:41.458 --> 00:03:44.708
[Hank] Whoa!
A second part of the treasure map!

00:03:44.792 --> 00:03:47.625
That's exciting. And disappointing.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.417
Uncle! Guess which one of your enemies
found a treasure map!

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:56.625
No, not him.

00:03:56.708 --> 00:03:59.208
No. That's not even a person.

00:03:59.917 --> 00:04:01.667
Yes!!

00:04:09.333 --> 00:04:10.875
[sign creaks]

00:04:10.958 --> 00:04:14.958
Okay, we're here, but what's this
supposed to be? A shoelace?

00:04:15.042 --> 00:04:18.333
I don't know,
but abandoned carnivals sure are creepy.

00:04:18.417 --> 00:04:21.417
It's not abandoned.
It's just closed on Mondays.

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:23.125
It's abandoned for the day.

00:04:24.333 --> 00:04:26.500
Ooh! Riches of a different sort.

00:04:27.417 --> 00:04:29.583
Hey, what's everyone going to do
with their share of the treasure?

00:04:29.667 --> 00:04:32.792
Good question.
Do you go boat, or helicopter?

00:04:32.875 --> 00:04:35.833
I think a better use would be
for extra server space.

00:04:35.917 --> 00:04:37.625
Nya! Yah-ha!

00:04:37.708 --> 00:04:39.625
Come back! We trusted you!

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.292
-[ding]
-Aaaah! I got ya!

00:04:44.375 --> 00:04:46.292
-[ding]
- Aaaaah!

00:04:46.375 --> 00:04:47.708
[ding]

00:04:47.792 --> 00:04:49.917
[all] No, no, nooo!

00:04:51.958 --> 00:04:53.083
[ding]

00:04:53.958 --> 00:04:56.458
That does it, Ginger!
You are out of the treasure hunt!

00:04:56.542 --> 00:04:59.250
No! Stop fighting me and look!

00:05:01.542 --> 00:05:04.375
[Hank] Ooh! Up there! There's another map!

00:05:04.458 --> 00:05:07.292
It's hanging with those festive
and decorative pennants.

00:05:09.208 --> 00:05:11.167
I don't see an easy way up.

00:05:11.958 --> 00:05:14.083
Hey, Ben, can you operate that thing?

00:05:14.167 --> 00:05:16.583
Don't be silly. Of course I can do it.

00:05:17.625 --> 00:05:18.625
[crunch]

00:05:18.708 --> 00:05:20.708
[crunch, crunch]

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:24.917
-[all cheer]
-All aboard.

00:05:26.042 --> 00:05:29.458
[all] Whoa! Wa-ho-hoa!

00:05:33.167 --> 00:05:34.792
Whoa!

00:05:35.583 --> 00:05:36.833
Go again!

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:40.083
[all] Woooo!

00:05:43.458 --> 00:05:45.167
Again!

00:05:56.833 --> 00:05:58.958
Yeah!

00:05:59.042 --> 00:06:01.042
Yeah! We did it!

00:06:01.125 --> 00:06:05.333
We sure did, buddy! Now let's go
crack this mystery together.

00:06:05.417 --> 00:06:07.417
-[groaning]
-We can do it!

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:09.542
Why don't we just take the map?

00:06:09.625 --> 00:06:12.833
Because it's better to let them
find the treasure and then take it!

00:06:12.917 --> 00:06:16.500
What good is tearing somebody's dream away
if you can't see the look on their faces?

00:06:16.583 --> 00:06:19.375
He-he! Good business lesson!

00:06:19.458 --> 00:06:21.333
Now hurry! To the vehicle!

00:06:24.042 --> 00:06:26.167
[adventure theme]

00:06:55.667 --> 00:06:58.667
Ninety-eight... ninety-nine...

00:06:58.750 --> 00:07:00.500
One hundred!

00:07:00.583 --> 00:07:01.917
One hundred and one!

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:06.500
That's exactly how many steps
the map says. This should be the place.

00:07:06.583 --> 00:07:10.667
-Keep your eyes open for treasure.
-I bet it's gonna be super well-hidden.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.875
Look at these pinecones stacked
next to that tree

00:07:14.958 --> 00:07:19.417
that happens to have a hole that's the
right size to throw a pinecone through.

00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:22.583
Coincidence? There's no such thing.

00:07:33.292 --> 00:07:34.417
Yes!

00:07:35.375 --> 00:07:37.208
[owl hoots]

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:39.500
Oh, no.

00:07:39.583 --> 00:07:42.625
So this is why more people don't grow up
to be treasure finders.

00:07:42.708 --> 00:07:44.750
-It's not worth the heartache.
-[deep rumble]

00:07:47.542 --> 00:07:50.083
-Wow!
-[all cheer]

00:07:53.458 --> 00:07:55.458
Wa-hay!

00:07:56.167 --> 00:07:59.042
Ooh! We did it! We're all rich!

00:07:59.125 --> 00:08:02.542
-[Darren] Aloooooooha!
-Oh, no!

00:08:02.625 --> 00:08:05.125
A forest spirit
guarding its cursed riches!

00:08:05.208 --> 00:08:07.625
Well, that doesn't sound like
a forest spirit. That sounds like--

00:08:07.708 --> 00:08:10.333
-Darren! And me, the CEO.
-What?

00:08:10.417 --> 00:08:13.292
What? Come on!
You can't take our treasure!

00:08:13.375 --> 00:08:16.792
You say that, but I have
a top-of-the-line Mega Grabber.

00:08:16.875 --> 00:08:21.792
-No, no, no, you can't do this to us!
-You lose again, losey losers!

00:08:21.875 --> 00:08:23.958
[evil laugh]

00:08:27.167 --> 00:08:30.667
Wait, we don't need to do this!

00:08:30.750 --> 00:08:34.125
-What?
-Get off my luxury balloon!

00:08:34.750 --> 00:08:37.042
[evil laugh]

00:08:37.125 --> 00:08:40.500
["Blue Danube" playing]

00:08:41.542 --> 00:08:46.083
Guys, no! This is danger!
You're endangering a little boy!

00:08:46.167 --> 00:08:49.417
Uh! We can't give up now!
We've come too far!

00:08:49.500 --> 00:08:51.417
And too high.

00:08:51.500 --> 00:08:54.583
-But the treasure isn't even real!
-What?

00:08:54.667 --> 00:08:56.542
I wanted to have fun with you all.

00:08:56.625 --> 00:08:59.917
So I stuck a fake map in your papers
when you were not looking.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:03.333
But there were clues all over town!

00:09:03.417 --> 00:09:06.042
Yep! In all the best summer places.

00:09:06.125 --> 00:09:08.042
How could you do this to us?

00:09:08.125 --> 00:09:12.292
I just wanted everyone to have fun!
Wasn't today fun?

00:09:12.375 --> 00:09:15.875
Well... I guess it was fun. Yeah.

00:09:15.958 --> 00:09:19.458
-I liked the roller coaster part.
-This balloon part is kind of neat.

00:09:19.542 --> 00:09:21.958
Plus we get to skip another
company organization day!

00:09:22.042 --> 00:09:25.875
Darren, do something! Why are you here
if you're not doing something?

00:09:25.958 --> 00:09:27.292
[giggles]

00:09:30.042 --> 00:09:31.792
I have an idea!

00:09:31.875 --> 00:09:33.667
-Ah! I'm slipping!
-[Angela] Help, Tom!

00:09:33.750 --> 00:09:36.750
-Everyone let go on the count of three.
-What? No!

00:09:36.833 --> 00:09:39.417
-You have to trust me!
-Okay.

00:09:39.500 --> 00:09:42.208
One... two... three!

00:09:42.292 --> 00:09:43.500
Ahhhhhh!

00:09:43.583 --> 00:09:45.417
[evil laughs]

00:09:45.500 --> 00:09:46.917
Waaa...

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:48.167
Waa...

00:09:48.250 --> 00:09:51.208
What now, Ben? Do you have
some cool science thing planned?

00:09:51.292 --> 00:09:55.000
Not exactly!
I have a cool geography thing planned!

00:09:55.083 --> 00:09:57.917
We've drifted over Ginger's house!

00:09:58.000 --> 00:09:59.792
[gulp] Ah!

00:10:05.958 --> 00:10:08.000
[Ginger] Cannonball!

00:10:10.917 --> 00:10:12.708
[all laughing]

00:10:13.583 --> 00:10:16.542
Well, this was a summer kick-off
for the record books.

00:10:16.625 --> 00:10:20.917
But wait, if none of this was real,
what was inside the treasure chest?

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:23.500
Oh, that? Just my bug collection.

00:10:24.375 --> 00:10:25.625
-Ha-ha.
-We did it!

00:10:25.708 --> 00:10:27.833
-We're even richer than before, Uncle.
-Ha!

00:10:27.917 --> 00:10:30.833
-[buzzing]
-This treasure's made of bees?

00:10:32.292 --> 00:10:34.417
[CEO] I'm too wealthy for this! Ow!

00:10:34.500 --> 00:10:36.750
-Oh!
