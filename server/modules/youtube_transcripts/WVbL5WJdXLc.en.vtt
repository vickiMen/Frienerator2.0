00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:07.280
I think I’m going to be sick!

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:10.080
No, no, NOOOOOOOOOO!

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:10.900
What, what, what?!

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:12.880
Ginger, will you be quiet, please?

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:16.120
We’re trying to watch Most Extreme
Romantic Ask-Outs.

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:18.660
Yeah, you’re ruining the most extreme romantic
part.

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:22.620
This garage was a much better place before
it was filled with disgusting romance.

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:30.440
Okay, I’ll telecommunicate with you later,
my darling Zee.

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:31.440
Digital-kiss.

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:34.600
So disgusting...

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Angela?!

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.340
I haven’t seen you since you and Tom...

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:40.400
Uh, on the video...

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:41.470
Well…

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:43.520
So what brings you here?

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:45.820
I was actually hoping to talk to Tom.

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:46.700
Have you seen him around?

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:47.440
No, sorry.

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:48.360
I haven't seen him…

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:49.640
That's weird…

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:52.360
Well, at least I got to watch Extreme Romantic
Ask-Outs.

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:53.960
I love those things.

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:57.240
Anyway, if you see Tom, will you tell him
came by?

00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:01.000
I’ll just throw my scalding hot tea in this
trash can and be on my way.

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:04.300
Tom?

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:08.240
Oh hey, Angela, what brings you kiss-- Here!

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:09.100
I mean here.

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.440
Disgusting…

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:31.720
What were you doing in the waste receptacle?

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:35.300
I wasn’t hiding to avoid Angela, if that’s
what you’re asking.

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:36.760
Disgusting--

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:37.820
Quit saying that!

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:38.500
Well, it is!

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:41.780
Sorry about these guys.

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:43.940
Did you want to talk to me about something?

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:45.900
As a matter of fact, I do.

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.700
Start with small talk.

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:50.840
Hey, Tom.

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:53.110
Did you hear about that new movie that came out?

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:56.660
Sounds like some
people liked it and some people did not like it.

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:02.140
Also, it seems like things have been a little
weird since we found out we kissed...

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:05.120
And I was hoping we could talk so things get
un-weird.

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.899
Right.

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:06.900
Talk.

00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:09.920
Yeah, I agree!

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:10.640
Really?

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:11.740
What a relief.

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:12.880
Okay, 'cause here's what I was thinking--

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:13.380
What?!

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:14.600
Not now!

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:17.100
We shouldn’t talk now...

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:17.760
Why?

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:21.120
Well, because we both have things to do now.

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:23.260
Oh, okay, I guess.

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:25.200
So when can we have a talk?

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:26.220
I don’t know.

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:27.140
In an hour?

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:28.600
Yeah, in an hour.

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:30.540
At, uh, the diner?

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:31.680
Perfect, it’s a date!

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:34.480
Yeah, like a date on the calendar, right?

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:36.480
I mean... Because every day is a date…

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:38.160
Okay…

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:40.600
Bye!

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:43.080
That was close.

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:50.460
Oh man, I just bought myself a sweet hour.

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:53.280
Actually you bought yourself…

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:57.800
Fifty-eight minutes until you’ll be at the
diner asking Angela out on a date.

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:58.700
A date?!

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:00.140
She said she wants to talk.

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:01.220
Come on, Tom.

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:05.320
Think for a second and you’ll easily decode
Angela’s signals.

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:09.900
Extreme romantic ask-outs…

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:12.680
I love those things…

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:13.780
Date.

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:14.780
Ask-out.

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:16.760
It’s a Daaaate.

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:19.640
You’re right, Ben!

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:21.400
Angela wants me to ask her out on a date!

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:24.170
And I only have fifty-eight minutes to figure
out how to do it!

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:25.350
More like forty-eight minutes.

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:27.030
That was a whole flashback, Tom.

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:32.260
And you better do it right because if there’s
one thing I learned from Most Extreme Romantic Ask-Outs

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:36.620
it’s that the ask-out sets the tone for
the whole relationship.

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:37.720
Okay…

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:38.640
Can I watch one?

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:39.720
You can watch them all.

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:40.860
I’ve got the whole series.

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:44.180
Oh yeah!

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:46.140
Nice going, Romeo!

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:48.400
Well, that's the best one yet.

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:54.360
Okay, so the most successful ask-outs involve
manned flight, a song comparing the relationship

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:56.600
to something beautiful, and or flowers.

00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:58.220
Seems like a lot…

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:00.720
Well, how much do you like Angela?

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:02.380
Like a lot a lot.

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:03.260
Alright!

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:04.620
Let's do this.

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:10.400
Honey, are you gonna order yet or you just still warming that bench?

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:11.780
Just a few more minutes.

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:13.180
I’m waiting for someone.

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:13.760
Oh.

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:15.020
You’re one of those.

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:17.680
No, no, I’m not one of those.

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:21.800
I’m a girl waiting for the guy I like to
definitely show up and tell me that he likes

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:22.560
me too.

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:24.700
Honey, I’ve seen this before.

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:30.000
Someone comes in, they order dinner for two,
and they leave alone with a doggy bag.

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:31.920
You’re making that up.

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:32.420
Right?

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:38.760
I don’t know, maybe I’m wrong.

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:42.460
I’m sure he’s been real clear about how
he feels.

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:44.920
Avoid Angela --

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:49.540
A date... on a calendar.

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:51.040
Oh no.

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:52.760
Rhonda, what if you’re right?

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:55.100
I’m always right, Angelica.

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:22.660
And…

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:23.220
There!

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:27.800
Your disgusting extreme romantic ask-out device
is ready to go.

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:31.460
Angela’s going to love this so much, she
probably won’t even care that you’re so late.

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:32.020
Late?

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:33.740
Look how late I am!

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:35.100
Why didn’t somebody tell me?

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:40.980
Ooh, what do you think this does?

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:44.400
I don’t know what I expected.

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:49.320
Maybe when our minds were erased, his feelings
for me were erased too.

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:51.380
That is a confusing thing to say.

00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:53.310
How could Tom stand me up like this?

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:55.980
I have so many sad feelings right now.

00:05:55.980 --> 00:06:00.680
It’s like my heart’s on an elevator that’s
going down and Tom pressed all the buttons.

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:02.760
Wouldn’t that stop the elevator?

00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:03.860
Can it, Rhonda!

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:14.400
And I’m done sitting here and waiting around
for him.

00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:16.080
You go, girl.

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:17.660
I will go girl!

00:06:20.420 --> 00:06:22.720
I don’t need no date

00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:27.340
‘Cause I got me!

00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:31.700
You left me at a diner

00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:36.060
But baby, now I’m free

00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:40.120
You think you can stand me up

00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:44.580
You think you can make me wait

00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:49.280
But I got me, babe

00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:54.340
So I don’t need no date!

00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:56.100
Yeah!

00:06:58.880 --> 00:06:59.400
Yay!

00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:01.580
Oh, yay, you're still here.

00:07:01.660 --> 00:07:05.699
Angela, I hope that you’re prepared for
the most extreme--

00:07:05.700 --> 00:07:07.700
Oh, I’m prepared, Tom.

00:07:07.700 --> 00:07:09.220
Prepared to leave.

00:07:09.220 --> 00:07:10.800
Angela, wait!

00:07:10.820 --> 00:07:13.540
Are we changing the location of our talk?

00:07:13.540 --> 00:07:14.160
Here.

00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:15.540
She left this for you.

00:07:15.550 --> 00:07:17.860
What is it, a letter explaining why she just
walked out the door?

00:07:17.860 --> 00:07:21.550
It’s a bill for all the food she ate waiting
for you.

00:07:21.550 --> 00:07:25.760
Also, she bought food for everyone else in
the diner.

00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:26.760
What?

00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:28.140
Why would she do that?

00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:30.760
Hey, that's the jerk from the song!

00:07:30.760 --> 00:07:31.860
Get him!

00:08:03.480 --> 00:08:04.700
How did the ask-out go?

00:08:04.700 --> 00:08:07.500
Did the thrusters compensate for the extra
rose density?

00:08:07.500 --> 00:08:08.300
Well…

00:08:08.680 --> 00:08:12.100
I wouldn’t be surprised if Angela never
speaks to me again.

00:08:12.100 --> 00:08:15.800
Okay Tom, we can still save this extreme ask-out.

00:08:15.800 --> 00:08:18.070
It’s gonna be tough, but with one elephant--

00:08:18.070 --> 00:08:19.070
No, Hank.

00:08:19.070 --> 00:08:21.260
I’m giving up on extreme ask-outs.

00:08:21.740 --> 00:08:25.880
For now I’m just wandering around town looking
for Angela at all the sad places.

00:08:25.880 --> 00:08:26.380
Okay.

00:08:26.460 --> 00:08:27.580
Where are you now?

00:08:27.580 --> 00:08:31.180
I’m at the saddest part of the park where
the ducks don’t even go.

00:08:31.180 --> 00:08:32.599
And I don't see her here either.

00:08:32.599 --> 00:08:34.140
Okay, Tom, here’s the plan.

00:08:34.140 --> 00:08:36.490
We’ve got to create a grid so we can --

00:08:36.490 --> 00:08:37.020
Hold on.

00:08:37.020 --> 00:08:37.920
I’ll call you back.

00:08:37.920 --> 00:08:38.420
Wait!

00:08:38.420 --> 00:08:39.540
If I could get a status--

00:08:43.340 --> 00:08:44.020
Hi, Angela.

00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:46.200
I am not talking to you.

00:08:46.200 --> 00:08:47.360
I don’t blame you.

00:08:48.340 --> 00:08:50.940
I can’t believe you left me waiting like
that!

00:08:50.940 --> 00:08:53.560
I’m so glad you’re talking to me again.

00:08:53.560 --> 00:08:54.380
No, I’m not.

00:08:54.800 --> 00:08:55.420
Okay.

00:08:58.080 --> 00:09:00.420
Stupid extreme ask-out show.

00:09:29.700 --> 00:09:31.160
Is this why you were late?

00:09:31.160 --> 00:09:33.640
You were setting up an extreme ask-out?

00:09:33.640 --> 00:09:34.180
For me?

00:09:34.180 --> 00:09:35.820
Well, yeah…

00:09:35.820 --> 00:09:37.200
And I wanted to do it right…

00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:39.560
But then I lost track of time, and...

00:09:41.060 --> 00:09:41.840
I’m sorry.

00:09:41.840 --> 00:09:42.980
Wow, Tom.

00:09:42.980 --> 00:09:47.980
Ever since we saw that stupid video of that
kiss, it’s been making everything weird.

00:09:47.980 --> 00:09:50.340
I wish we could go back to the way it was
before.

00:09:50.340 --> 00:09:52.820
You mean when we liked each other but we never
talked about it?

00:09:52.820 --> 00:09:53.540
Exactly!

00:09:53.780 --> 00:09:55.140
I know how to do that.

00:09:55.140 --> 00:09:58.880
It was so much easier pretending we were just
friends.

00:09:59.820 --> 00:10:03.040
You know, there’s a carnival in town this
Saturday...

00:10:03.040 --> 00:10:06.050
I’m sure Ben, Hank and Ginger want to go...

00:10:06.050 --> 00:10:07.710
Why don’t you come with us?

00:10:07.710 --> 00:10:09.500
No dating pressure making it weird...

00:10:09.500 --> 00:10:12.300
Just a group of friends doing something fun
together.

00:10:13.120 --> 00:10:14.240
Sure, Tom.

00:10:14.240 --> 00:10:17.140
It’s a date -- but not a date date!

00:10:17.140 --> 00:10:17.780
Right.

00:10:17.960 --> 00:10:19.340
Not a date date.

00:10:19.340 --> 00:10:21.360
More like a friend event.

00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:23.220
Yes, a friend event.

00:10:24.920 --> 00:10:27.080
I think we really figured this out.

00:10:27.080 --> 00:10:28.820
Me too, Tom.

00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:33.120
Are you still watching Most Extreme Romantic
Ask-Outs?

00:10:33.120 --> 00:10:33.620
Nope.

00:10:33.620 --> 00:10:35.300
Most Embarrassing Ask-Out Flame-Outs.

00:10:38.200 --> 00:10:39.060
They make a nice--

00:10:40.620 --> 00:10:41.760
Wow!

00:10:41.760 --> 00:10:44.480
You never think it’s your hot air balloon
that’ll get popped.

00:10:44.480 --> 00:10:46.480
At least they're... together.

00:10:46.860 --> 00:10:48.860
Do you know which button never gets stuck?

00:10:49.180 --> 00:10:50.940
The subscribe button!

00:10:51.080 --> 00:10:51.580
Try it!

00:10:52.120 --> 00:10:53.200
'Sup Angela?

00:10:55.280 --> 00:10:57.520
- We can totally still go out on a --

00:10:57.520 --> 00:10:58.080
- A date?

00:10:58.240 --> 00:10:58.960
Not a date!

00:11:02.100 --> 00:11:03.600
Oh yeah! Oh yeah!

00:11:03.760 --> 00:11:04.880
Good save, Hank!
