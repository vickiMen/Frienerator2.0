00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:05.100
I don't know what else to say.
That works out good because I'm not listening.

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:10.350
I feel terrible, I really do.
Oh, I'm sorry. Did my back hurt your knife?

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:14.450
Rachel!
Say that I'm friends with her. We spend some

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:17.200
time together. Is that so terrible?
Yes.

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:21.289
It's that terrible?!
Yes, Monica! You don't get it. It's bad enough

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:27.129
she stole the guy who might actually be the
person that I'm supposed to be with. But now...

00:00:27.129 --> 00:00:33.840
she's actually... But now she's actually stealing
you!

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:42.200
Me? What are you talking about? Nobody could
steal me from you. I mean just beacause I'm

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:49.220
friends with her doesn't make me any less
friends with you. Honey. I mean, you're my...

00:00:49.220 --> 00:01:02.060
And we're... Oh, I love you!
I love you too!

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:07.600
You guys, um, I know that this really doesn't
have anything to do with me. But, um, I love

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:20.630
you guys too! Ugh, I really needed that.
Look, I know that you're in a place right

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:27.609
now where you really need to hate Julie's
guts. But, she didn't do anything wrong. She's

00:01:27.609 --> 00:01:34.149
just a girl who met a guy and now they go
out. I really think if you gave her a chance,

00:01:34.149 --> 00:01:41.260
you'd like her. Will you just give that a
chance? For me?

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:49.000
I'd do anything for you, you know that.
I'd do anything for you!

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.560
Wait, wait, wait, wait!
