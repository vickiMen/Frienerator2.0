00:00:03.917 --> 00:00:05.792
[Jeremy] Oh, yummy!

00:00:05.875 --> 00:00:07.792
[appreciative murmurs]

00:00:07.875 --> 00:00:10.667
What are you all doing?

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:14.458
If we want to go on every scary ride
at the carnival today,

00:00:14.542 --> 00:00:17.042
we have to be there in 15 minutes!

00:00:17.125 --> 00:00:19.500
Oh, sorry, Ginger.
We were waiting for Hank,

00:00:19.583 --> 00:00:22.042
then we got distracted
by this mystery cake.

00:00:22.125 --> 00:00:25.875
Yeah. We don't know why it's here,
but you don't question cake.

00:00:25.958 --> 00:00:29.167
[gulps] Wait! Don't question cake...

00:00:29.583 --> 00:00:31.917
This all feels eerily familiar.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:33.458
Huh? What's eerily familiar?

00:00:33.542 --> 00:00:35.667
This is a birthday cake.

00:00:36.333 --> 00:00:37.458
It's Hank's birthday!

00:00:37.542 --> 00:00:40.833
-Oh, a birthday. I hear those are fun.
-It's not fun!

00:00:40.917 --> 00:00:45.792
Every year he forces us to help him
make his own episode of his favorite show,

00:00:45.875 --> 00:00:47.708
"Bongo and McGillicuddy."

00:00:48.167 --> 00:00:52.375
And he gets all bossy and mean and...
not Hank-like.

00:00:53.417 --> 00:00:54.958
That's disgusting!

00:00:55.042 --> 00:00:57.708
Huh! I guess the carnival trip is off.

00:00:58.167 --> 00:01:00.125
There's no way out of this one.

00:01:00.333 --> 00:01:01.500
[footsteps]

00:01:02.125 --> 00:01:04.542
Huh? Oh, no, I think I hear him coming.

00:01:05.208 --> 00:01:06.833
[footsteps get closer]

00:01:12.125 --> 00:01:14.083
[door creaks]

00:01:15.208 --> 00:01:16.583
Eugh.

00:01:16.667 --> 00:01:18.000
[coughs]

00:01:18.083 --> 00:01:22.292
Maybe there &lt;i&gt;is &lt;/i&gt;a way out of doing this.
Guys, Hank is sick.

00:01:22.375 --> 00:01:23.792
No, I'm okay.

00:01:23.875 --> 00:01:25.458
I just need fluids.

00:01:25.542 --> 00:01:26.958
-[wheezes]
-Hank.

00:01:27.042 --> 00:01:31.417
That sounds bad. We better let you rest.

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.333
Maybe you're right. [coughs]
It might be contagious.

00:01:34.417 --> 00:01:38.500
Well, you definitely sound contagious,
so we'll celebrate you on another day.

00:01:38.583 --> 00:01:41.792
Yeah! Carnival time!

00:01:43.458 --> 00:01:46.000
Well, at least you're still here, Jeremy.

00:01:46.083 --> 00:01:49.667
Oh, yeah. I'm still here...
and I got questions!

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:52.958
What other germ have you been
hanging out with behind my back?

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:03.292
[cheering]

00:02:08.333 --> 00:02:09.958
&lt;i&gt;-Oh, no!&lt;/i&gt;
-Watch TV

00:02:10.042 --> 00:02:11.917
and sip that soup. I'll get you a blankie.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.292
Let's see the other germs
stand up to that!

00:02:14.375 --> 00:02:15.458
I'm sorry, okay?

00:02:15.542 --> 00:02:18.875
I really didn't wanna get sick,
believe me. [snottery sniff]

00:02:18.958 --> 00:02:21.333
I'd rather have my usual birthday
where I...

00:02:21.417 --> 00:02:23.833
[coughs] ...bring my favorite
TV show to life.

00:02:23.917 --> 00:02:25.667
Instead, I have to sit here...

00:02:26.792 --> 00:02:28.208
[splutters]

00:02:28.292 --> 00:02:31.125
Oh, man!
And now there's soup on the remote.

00:02:31.208 --> 00:02:33.583
Will you quit being a grump? I'll get it.

00:02:33.667 --> 00:02:35.500
-[crackling]
-Stop! You're making it worse!

00:02:35.583 --> 00:02:36.625
You'll fry the buttons!

00:02:41.125 --> 00:02:42.167
[grunts]

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:44.333
[both] Bongo and McGillicuddy?

00:02:44.417 --> 00:02:46.958
Well, ain't this a kick
in the cartoon caboose?

00:02:47.042 --> 00:02:49.792
It's Hank..,. and Jeremy.

00:02:49.875 --> 00:02:52.458
-[roars]
-You're right, McGillicuddy.

00:02:52.542 --> 00:02:56.375
Jeremy's a no-good germ
who makes everyone sick. Cuff him!

00:02:57.542 --> 00:02:59.667
I didn't infect him! Really!

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:01.417
He's telling the truth, guys.

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:04.125
This is my fault.
I treated soap like a suggestion.

00:03:04.208 --> 00:03:06.667
Hmm. Well, I'm still watching you, Blue.

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:10.000
And I'm hugging you, Hank.
It's been too long.

00:03:10.083 --> 00:03:11.417
[McGillicuddy chuckles]

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:13.250
This is amazing!

00:03:13.333 --> 00:03:17.042
My remote pulled you through the TV
because of a combination of soup,

00:03:17.125 --> 00:03:18.792
static electricity

00:03:18.875 --> 00:03:21.000
-and birthday magic.
-Whoa, whoa.

00:03:21.083 --> 00:03:24.000
If it's your birthday,
then where's the party?

00:03:24.083 --> 00:03:25.875
Uh, nowhere.

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:30.000
It got moved to another day
because I'm sick.

00:03:31.083 --> 00:03:32.958
Well, that is just not acceptable.

00:03:33.042 --> 00:03:35.417
I'm declaring a special police mission...

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:39.167
to throw you a birthday bash
with all your TV friends!

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:42.625
[excited squeals]

00:03:42.708 --> 00:03:45.875
We're making good time.
Next we hit the Bumper Boats.

00:03:45.958 --> 00:03:48.125
Then dry off on the Tilt-a-Whirl.

00:03:48.208 --> 00:03:49.333
Move your butts!

00:03:50.458 --> 00:03:53.792
I'm sorry, Ginger.
I'm just distracted for some reason.

00:03:53.875 --> 00:03:56.125
Yeah. This should be fun,

00:03:56.208 --> 00:03:58.250
but something feels off.

00:03:58.333 --> 00:04:02.833
Thanks for being with me on my birthday.
Wouldn't have been the same without you.

00:04:02.917 --> 00:04:04.958
That's a bit on the nose, but...

00:04:05.625 --> 00:04:06.625
accurate.

00:04:07.125 --> 00:04:09.292
What we did to Hank was wrong.

00:04:09.375 --> 00:04:13.583
But he was gonna make us sick,
or make us make a bad movie.

00:04:13.667 --> 00:04:16.208
You guys, we have to make it up to him.

00:04:16.875 --> 00:04:18.125
But how?

00:04:18.208 --> 00:04:21.667
Step right up! Step right up!
Get something for your friends

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:24.042
-that couldn't be here today.
-That's it!

00:04:24.125 --> 00:04:26.333
Let's win Hank a prize, and fast!

00:04:26.417 --> 00:04:29.042
He's probably feeling miserable right now.

00:04:29.125 --> 00:04:30.875
Let's party!

00:04:30.958 --> 00:04:32.500
[laser beam zapping]

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:38.292
Well, hello there! Cheerio.

00:04:39.375 --> 00:04:40.667
Waaah!

00:04:43.833 --> 00:04:47.292
Watch what you're doing!
You almost zapped in Kaptain Kriminal,

00:04:47.375 --> 00:04:50.875
-the baddest baddie in the Tooniverse.
-Ooh, that would've been bad,

00:04:50.958 --> 00:04:53.042
'cause this party is for good guys only!

00:04:53.125 --> 00:04:54.417
-That's right.
-[gibbers]

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:58.292
-Hey, birthday boy, no more trick shots.
-Yes, sir.

00:04:58.375 --> 00:04:59.375
[yells]

00:04:59.458 --> 00:05:02.833
-[hip-hop playing]
-[cheering and whooping]

00:05:03.792 --> 00:05:05.125
[Hank] Yes! Woo!

00:05:08.458 --> 00:05:11.000
[McGillicuddy whoops]

00:05:11.792 --> 00:05:13.958
Ooh, yeah!

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:16.417
[laughter]

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:19.083
Today was almost a bad birthday.

00:05:19.167 --> 00:05:22.292
But now...
it may be my best birthday ever!

00:05:22.375 --> 00:05:25.417
And none of this would've happened
if I wasn't sick.

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:29.917
To the germ that got me sick
and brought me together with you!

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.500
Aw, come on! I'm the one
who made this all happen.

00:05:33.583 --> 00:05:35.625
[cheering and whooping]

00:05:37.333 --> 00:05:40.958
Fine! I know when I'm not wanted.

00:05:42.125 --> 00:05:45.208
-[cheering]
-Hey, Mr. DJ, crank up the bass!

00:05:45.292 --> 00:05:47.958
-Yes!
-[music pounding]

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:55.167
[silence falls]

00:05:55.250 --> 00:05:56.917
Well, well!

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:58.750
What have we here?

00:05:58.833 --> 00:06:01.917
A nice little birthday party.

00:06:02.417 --> 00:06:06.292
It would be a shame
if someone were to crash it.

00:06:06.375 --> 00:06:08.667
Someone like me.

00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:10.500
[cackles evilly]

00:06:10.583 --> 00:06:12.250
[McGillicuddy gibbers angrily]

00:06:12.333 --> 00:06:13.792
Good point, McGillicuddy.

00:06:13.875 --> 00:06:18.542
Now let's show this pathetic punk
that this party is for protagonists.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:21.792
-[yelling]
-[Kaptain Kriminal laughs]

00:06:23.708 --> 00:06:25.875
[all cackling]

00:06:29.917 --> 00:06:31.125
Aw!

00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:33.833
Whoa!

00:06:36.750 --> 00:06:39.208
Grr! This carnival cheats!

00:06:40.667 --> 00:06:42.458
Give me back my mustache comb!

00:06:42.542 --> 00:06:45.125
-I need it to comb my mustache.
-[cackles]

00:06:48.292 --> 00:06:49.833
[evil cackling]

00:06:52.292 --> 00:06:53.875
All right, Kaptain Kriminal.

00:06:53.958 --> 00:06:56.500
Give me that remote so I can zap you away.

00:06:56.583 --> 00:07:00.000
Why, certainly, my dear birthday boy.

00:07:00.083 --> 00:07:01.583
Or better yet,

00:07:01.667 --> 00:07:03.750
we can split it.

00:07:05.083 --> 00:07:07.042
[Kriminal cackles evilly]

00:07:08.125 --> 00:07:11.125
That remote was our only way
to get rid of 'em. We're doomed!

00:07:11.208 --> 00:07:13.958
No one's ever doomed
when police are around, Hank.

00:07:14.042 --> 00:07:16.250
Think. Where can we find another remote?

00:07:16.958 --> 00:07:21.583
I've got it! There's always extra remotes
in the couch cushions.

00:07:21.667 --> 00:07:24.542
Clever. But those crazy criminal crashers
have the couch covered.

00:07:24.625 --> 00:07:27.958
-[whoops excitedly]
-No. It's too dangerous.

00:07:28.042 --> 00:07:31.833
-[McGillicuddy whoops]
-Hey! That monkey stole my snack!

00:07:36.625 --> 00:07:37.958
Yes! Remotes!

00:07:38.042 --> 00:07:41.542
Now we just need a static-y blanket
and a bowl of Jeremy's soup.

00:07:41.625 --> 00:07:43.500
Wait. Where is Jeremy?

00:07:45.083 --> 00:07:47.708
"Sure, police adventures are fun,

00:07:47.792 --> 00:07:50.125
but you should see
how they wreck friendships.

00:07:50.208 --> 00:07:51.792
Zero stars."

00:07:53.458 --> 00:07:56.792
Why are you hiding in here?
We need your soup to save the party!

00:07:56.875 --> 00:07:58.375
Oh, is that so?

00:07:58.458 --> 00:08:01.083
Are you sure you don't need
one of your TV friends

00:08:01.167 --> 00:08:02.958
or the germ that got you sick?

00:08:03.042 --> 00:08:06.167
Uh-oh, looks like we've got us a Code 15.

00:08:07.042 --> 00:08:08.333
Jealous friend.

00:08:09.083 --> 00:08:10.958
Hey, buddy, are you okay?

00:08:11.500 --> 00:08:14.292
What do you care? Ah, leave me alone.

00:08:14.375 --> 00:08:17.292
Look, I'm sorry I got sick.
It was selfish.

00:08:17.750 --> 00:08:20.125
I should have thought about
how you would feel

00:08:20.208 --> 00:08:22.917
while I was coughing and wheezing
on my birthday.

00:08:24.125 --> 00:08:25.583
Can you forgive me?

00:08:27.208 --> 00:08:31.042
So, you promise you'll never get sick,
ever, ever, ever again?

00:08:31.583 --> 00:08:33.708
I never will.

00:08:33.792 --> 00:08:34.917
Promise.

00:08:36.125 --> 00:08:38.750
-[jolly funfair music playing]
-Hey, come here!

00:08:38.833 --> 00:08:40.708
-Give me that balloon back!
-No way!

00:08:40.792 --> 00:08:43.417
-It's proof your carnival is rigged.
-[balloon clangs]

00:08:43.500 --> 00:08:46.917
And soon everyone will know!

00:08:48.167 --> 00:08:49.500
All right, let's make a deal.

00:08:49.583 --> 00:08:52.667
Give back the balloon
and I'll let you have any prize you want.

00:08:52.750 --> 00:08:55.083
No way! This is about justice!

00:08:55.167 --> 00:08:56.375
Hold on, Ginger.

00:08:56.458 --> 00:08:58.208
Any prize?

00:08:59.875 --> 00:09:02.333
Let's mute these birthday baddies!

00:09:02.833 --> 00:09:04.625
[cackling]

00:09:07.833 --> 00:09:08.833
Huh?

00:09:08.917 --> 00:09:10.500
-Zap!
-Argh!

00:09:11.250 --> 00:09:13.958
Zap! Zap! Zap! Ha!

00:09:14.042 --> 00:09:18.208
-Huh? Oh, no, I'm out of juice!
-[cackles]

00:09:25.708 --> 00:09:27.000
[zapping]

00:09:27.083 --> 00:09:31.042
-Enough! Put down the remote.
-[growls]

00:09:32.125 --> 00:09:35.167
You think I'm bluffing? Ha ha!

00:09:35.250 --> 00:09:39.750
Put 'em down
or say sayonara to the simian!

00:09:39.833 --> 00:09:41.583
[McGillicuddy groans]

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.875
Hank, remember that rule
about no more trick shots?

00:09:46.375 --> 00:09:49.000
Well, some rules were meant to be broken.

00:09:55.500 --> 00:09:57.917
[bloodcurdling yell]

00:09:59.083 --> 00:10:00.083
[grunts]

00:10:00.167 --> 00:10:02.792
Happy birthday to me!

00:10:02.875 --> 00:10:07.083
-[cheering and whooping]
-[hip-hop playing]

00:10:10.042 --> 00:10:12.125
Yay... [coughs]

00:10:12.208 --> 00:10:14.917
[Jeremy] Okay, party's over.
Everybody out.

00:10:17.167 --> 00:10:19.875
Don't crowd him! Give him some space.
Let him breathe.

00:10:19.958 --> 00:10:21.583
Wait! He's opening his eyes.

00:10:21.667 --> 00:10:23.208
Wait, what happened?

00:10:23.292 --> 00:10:24.792
Jeremy, where's Bongo?

00:10:24.875 --> 00:10:27.625
And McGillicuddy?
And the rest of my cartoon pals?

00:10:27.708 --> 00:10:31.625
You were dreaming.
Jeremy says you were sleeping for hours.

00:10:31.708 --> 00:10:33.125
We're glad you're up now.

00:10:33.208 --> 00:10:36.750
We got you something that will
make this birthday special after all.

00:10:38.083 --> 00:10:39.500
Uh... thanks?

00:10:39.583 --> 00:10:41.000
[Tom] Pretty nice, huh?

00:10:41.083 --> 00:10:44.708
With these guys around,
it's like Bongo and McGillicuddy

00:10:44.792 --> 00:10:47.208
are gonna be in the garage with you.

00:10:47.292 --> 00:10:49.542
How crazy is that, huh?

00:10:49.625 --> 00:10:50.917
[chuckles]
