Soon my plan to become mayor
and destroy Tom and Ben Enterprises

Um, Uncle?
Don't you remember what just happened?

00:00:17.125 --> 00:00:20.083
Tom had a secret system
to become mayor.

00:00:20.167 --> 00:00:22.167
But when it was stolen by you,

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:25.375
it all came down
to the Mayor Factor competition.

00:00:25.458 --> 00:00:27.042
And you did not win. Tom won.

00:00:27.125 --> 00:00:30.833
I know but it's not fair!
I want to be mayor!

00:00:32.458 --> 00:00:33.333
Ow!

00:00:33.417 --> 00:00:34.958
Now my kicking leg hurts.

00:00:35.042 --> 00:00:37.708

I'm doing a security sweep
for the new mayor.

Sir, do you mind telling me
why you aren't eating that soup?

00:01:08.417 --> 00:01:10.542
I'm waiting for it to cool down.

Bah! Way ahead of you.

00:01:29.708 --> 00:01:33.208
We have to decide when I'm supposed
to wear my mayor sash

00:01:33.292 --> 00:01:35.958
and when I should probably wear
my mayor button.

00:01:36.042 --> 00:01:37.583
That's not what I meant.

00:01:37.667 --> 00:01:41.042
I'm talking about the minor civic
infrastructure issues

00:01:41.125 --> 00:01:42.917
that urgently need to be dealt with.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.042
Whoa! I don't know
what those words mean.

00:01:45.125 --> 00:01:49.250
But I do know that being mayor is
about wearing sashes, cutting ribbons,

00:01:49.333 --> 00:01:51.917
and making sure everyone is happy...
which they are.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.208
I'm not happy, Mr. Mayor.

00:01:54.292 --> 00:01:57.333
I'm tired,
my shows weren't on last night,

00:01:57.417 --> 00:01:59.708
and earlier today I stepped on a bee.

00:01:59.792 --> 00:02:02.333
Sounds like a job for Mayor Tom.

00:02:02.417 --> 00:02:03.542
Let's see that foot.

00:02:04.292 --> 00:02:05.417
-Tom, no!
-Hmmm.

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:09.583
Rhonda's complaints and feet have nothing
to do with a mayor's responsibilities.

00:02:09.667 --> 00:02:14.292
Oh, yeah, you're probably right.
Besides, no one is really happy, I mean...

with all the whites

00:02:21.875 --> 00:02:23.292
and ruined his laundry.

00:02:23.375 --> 00:02:26.250
I had no idea people were so unhappy.

00:02:26.333 --> 00:02:28.125
I have to do something about this.

00:02:29.167 --> 00:02:30.875
Ahem! Citizens!

00:02:30.958 --> 00:02:34.500
I am your mayor and I want to put
your simple minds at ease.

00:02:34.583 --> 00:02:40.542
I hereby promise that I will not rest
until everyone in this town is happy.

Oh, right.

00:02:48.875 --> 00:02:50.792
That's not a promise.

Hey, what's going on?
Why are you screaming at strangers?

Guys, a lot of people
in this town aren't happy

00:03:19.208 --> 00:03:21.875
and that means I'm not the mayor
I promised to be.

00:03:21.958 --> 00:03:24.833
Tom, there's always gonna be
unhappy people in a town.

And...

That's why they call it a town!

00:08:07.875 --> 00:08:09.458
Get outta here!

00:08:09.542 --> 00:08:13.000
I just became Happy Citizen of the Day,
you can't take that back.

00:08:13.083 --> 00:08:14.542
&lt;i&gt;♪ Rhonda, Rhonda, Rhonda! ♪&lt;/i&gt;

[helicopter hovering]

00:08:16.458 --> 00:08:17.583
Yeah!

00:08:18.125 --> 00:08:19.292
Woah-oh!

00:08:19.375 --> 00:08:21.000
Ma'am! Well, OK, yeah, just one.

00:08:24.625 --> 00:08:25.708
Oh, man!

00:08:25.792 --> 00:08:28.875
Hey, Tom! Why so blue?
It's a town party.

00:08:28.958 --> 00:08:31.167
This town party is ruining the town!

00:08:31.250 --> 00:08:32.875
And I can't make it stop.

00:08:32.958 --> 00:08:34.792
[maniacal laughter]

00:08:34.875 --> 00:08:36.958
Hmm. Oh, yeah! I see what you mean.

00:08:37.042 --> 00:08:38.500
People's hands are in the air

00:08:38.583 --> 00:08:40.667
and they're waving them
like they just don't care.

00:08:40.750 --> 00:08:42.792
I care. Because I'm the mayor.

00:08:42.875 --> 00:08:44.292
It's my job to care.

00:08:44.375 --> 00:08:47.500
But now I guess it's also my job
to clean this up.

00:08:47.583 --> 00:08:51.375
These people aren't gonna stop partying
just because you start cleaning.

00:08:51.458 --> 00:08:54.083
If they see a broom,
they're just gonna put a wig on it

00:08:54.167 --> 00:08:55.833
and start dancing with it.

00:08:55.917 --> 00:08:57.458
This is it. Great idea!

00:08:57.542 --> 00:08:58.458
Let's go!

00:09:03.917 --> 00:09:05.875
Stop your dancing, citizens!

00:09:05.958 --> 00:09:07.875
I'm shutting this party down!

00:09:07.958 --> 00:09:09.292
[crowd boos]

00:09:10.667 --> 00:09:13.625
And starting a new party.
A clean-up party!

00:09:16.667 --> 00:09:18.542
[whistles]

00:09:28.042 --> 00:09:29.208
[all] Hey!

00:09:30.167 --> 00:09:31.667
-Hey!
-Whoo, yeah!

00:09:31.750 --> 00:09:34.542
Hank, can you lead that conga line
all the way to the dump?

00:09:34.625 --> 00:09:36.792
It would be my honor, Your Honor.

00:09:37.375 --> 00:09:38.292
[all] Hey!

00:09:38.375 --> 00:09:39.458
[all] Woo-hoo!

00:09:39.542 --> 00:09:40.833
[all] Hey!

00:09:40.917 --> 00:09:41.792
[all] Hey!

00:09:41.875 --> 00:09:43.125
[all] Whoo!

00:09:43.208 --> 00:09:44.500
[all] Hey!

00:09:44.583 --> 00:09:45.500
[all] Hey!

00:09:46.833 --> 00:09:47.792
[all] Hey!

00:09:49.792 --> 00:09:52.250
So, it kind of seems
like we're doing work.

00:09:52.333 --> 00:09:54.208
[giggles] Just dance it out!

00:09:54.292 --> 00:09:56.417
Well, this was almost a disaster.

00:09:56.500 --> 00:09:59.417
I guess it's not a mayor's job
to make everybody happy.

00:09:59.500 --> 00:10:02.875
Unless you're Mayor Cheer,
from Mayor Cheer and the Smile Squad.

00:10:02.958 --> 00:10:06.750
I'm not sure if that's an actual show
or just a toothpaste commercial.

00:10:06.833 --> 00:10:10.625
Besides, if there was no unhappiness,
how would we know what happiness is?

00:10:10.708 --> 00:10:12.208
Huh, if you think about it,

00:10:12.292 --> 00:10:16.333
that's a really deep and smart thing
I just said, so... you're welcome.

00:10:16.417 --> 00:10:19.417
So, Tom, now that this is under control,

00:10:19.500 --> 00:10:21.917
I assume you'll be referring
to my spreadsheet

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:25.208
of civic infrastructure issues
for your next mayoral decision.

00:10:25.292 --> 00:10:27.583
No, Ben, I've learned my lesson.

00:10:27.667 --> 00:10:31.917
I don't think I'll be making
a mayor decision for a long time.

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:33.292
Argh!

00:10:33.375 --> 00:10:36.875
Seriously, can you believe
how smart that thing I said was?

00:10:36.958 --> 00:10:38.958
Maybe I should be mayor.

00:10:39.042 --> 00:10:41.417
But that's a story for another day.

00:10:42.167 --> 00:10:43.917
