Oh, yeah! Oh, yeah!

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:11.840
What? Why are you dancing?
You're supposed to be brainstorming ideas

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:14.960
for something to do on the mayor's float
at the Founder's Day Parade!

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:17.960
Well, we were brainstorming,
but then it turned into...

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:19.440
[music on]
..a dance party!

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:22.680
Like all our brainstorming sessions!

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:23.920
[Tom] Ha ha! Yeah!

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.360
[music stops]
Guys, this is important.

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:27.600
Tom's the new mayor.

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:31.680
His presentation at this parade
will set the tone for the whole year.

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:36.160
Lucky for you, I've prepared something
that's really going to impress the crowd.

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:39.560
Hm. "Our cyclical municipal
dynamics of..."

Ben, this is just a boring speech.

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.800
B-b-b-boring speech?

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:48.200
It's a detailed summary
of the state of the town!

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:51.280
You're the mayor. What are you gonna do?
Dance around for people?

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.360
Whoa! That's it!
My presentation will be a big mayor dance!

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.600
Yeah, thanks.

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:01.400
-Smart brain-thought, Ben.
-No, that's not what I--

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:05.320
Yeah, Ben. We are picking up
what you are throwing down!

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.160

OK, this is fun, but if we could just
get back to the data.

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:18.840
Oh, yeah. I can work the data in.

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:21.320
Ooh.

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:23.480
Oh! Ow! My knee!

-Aw, man.
-Oh, Ben.

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:27.960
Look what you did. How am I going to do
my big mayor dance now?

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:30.920
Don't blame Ben. He didn't know
his idea was so dangerous!

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.280
My idea was fine!
You guys just didn't listen to me!

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:36.640

your own leg,

but I have something that can help.

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:58.520
-Will it fix my twisted knee?
-No.

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:01.720
It will fix the communication problem
that led to your twisted knee.

-What communication problem?
-We do not speak at the same level.

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:09.520
Because I am very smart and the rest
of you are...smart-challenged.

Ben, the problem isn't the way we talk.
It's the way you talk.

[bleeping] The quandary we face
is not our lack of vocabulary

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:45.160
but rather your inability to speak
in a way that connects with your friends.

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:48.480
Oh! Huh! See?
We're communicating already.

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:53.680
[Ben] I just want to have an intellectual

-[Xenon] You have them with me, Benbug.
-I know, Zeenie-Panini.

But I wish I could have them with Tom

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:03.000
Well, if you're looking for some friends
who are as smart as you,

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:05.760
you should join the SMARTIES.

-Of course. There's chapters everywhere.

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:17.000
You should go
to one of their SMARTIE parties.

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:21.040
Pst, I couldn't help but overhear.
Are you looking for a new hat?

No, dummy! This is a computer store.
Go away!

Ben, that's SMARTIES secret code.

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:47.800

This is impressive-- Oh!

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:54.000
Welcome to the SMARTIE party.
We'll need two forms of genius, please.

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:57.440
Uh, let's see. I've got a letter
from my high school science teacher.

00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:59.680
I always carry it around.

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:03.320
And of course, my new invention,
the Brainerator.

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:06.640
-That is a wonderful invention!
-Oh, great.

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:09.200
Now if you'll excuse me, I really wouldn't
mind some of that red punch.

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:13.480
Ah-ah! Punch is for SMARTIES,
but you are not a SMARTIE yet.

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:17.480
First, you have to prove
that you're not just a... normal.

It's the Fibonacci Sequence.

Looks a little tight, if you ask me.

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:49.120

00:09:44.320 --> 00:09:45.440
[crowd booing]

00:09:45.520 --> 00:09:49.200
-Ah, the mayor's routine makes no sense!
-Boo!

00:09:49.280 --> 00:09:52.720
[Angela] Tom, we have to do
something else. Maybe we can dance you.

00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:54.040
Wha...?

00:09:54.120 --> 00:09:56.640
-Whoa!
-[crowd cheering]

00:09:56.720 --> 00:09:58.880
-Whoa! Huh!
-Whoa!

00:10:01.560 --> 00:10:03.080
[Tom] Oh, no! No!

00:10:04.640 --> 00:10:06.120
-Huh?
-Gotcha.

00:10:06.200 --> 00:10:08.400
[strains]

00:10:08.480 --> 00:10:09.640
[Tom] Ah.

00:10:11.080 --> 00:10:13.640
Is there room on the float
for one more... friend?

00:10:13.720 --> 00:10:16.960
Are you here to make fun of us again?
Because if you are, make it quick.

00:10:17.040 --> 00:10:20.280
No, I'm here to help you guys...
my real friends.

00:10:20.360 --> 00:10:23.600
-If you'll let me.
-Hm.

00:10:23.680 --> 00:10:26.000
[Tom] Uh... Well...

00:10:26.080 --> 00:10:30.840
-Uh... Inherently, Ben. Inherently.
-Well, that's not what inherently means.

00:10:30.920 --> 00:10:34.440
I think you-- Oh, who cares?
Let's move to the mayor's groove!

00:10:34.520 --> 00:10:36.280
[party music plays]

00:10:36.360 --> 00:10:38.000
[Angela] Yeah! Check it out!

00:10:39.440 --> 00:10:41.240
Yeah! Whoo!

00:10:41.320 --> 00:10:43.320
