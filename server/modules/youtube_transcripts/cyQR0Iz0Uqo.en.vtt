[Angela] It was the day of the big dance,

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:07.750
the most romantic event of the year.

00:00:07.833 --> 00:00:09.042
[romantic music playing]

00:00:09.125 --> 00:00:13.083
The theme was Summer in Winter,
and my friends were hosting it.

00:00:14.083 --> 00:00:16.042
I loved my dress.

00:00:16.125 --> 00:00:19.208
Tom and I were sure to be
king and queen of the dance.

00:00:20.417 --> 00:00:22.292
Everything was perfect.

00:00:23.833 --> 00:00:26.083
-[music stops]
-[squeals]

00:00:27.417 --> 00:00:31.417
Oh, no! The pipes all burst
and the floor is covered in ice!

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.042
Da-da-da!

00:00:33.125 --> 00:00:37.292
What a tragedy! I guess we have to ditch
this dance and start a hockey league.

00:00:37.375 --> 00:00:39.917
What? No, Ginger! How did this happen?

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.083
-Don't question a miracle!
-Sorry, Ginger,

00:00:42.167 --> 00:00:44.250
this dance is way too important to cancel.

00:00:44.333 --> 00:00:46.833
We're gonna turn it into a Snow Ball!

00:00:49.375 --> 00:00:51.708
[Angela] I was worried
about the frozen floor,

00:00:51.792 --> 00:00:55.292
but not even the garage's bad plumbing
could ruin this.

00:00:56.042 --> 00:00:59.875
Okay, I got the speakers all set up
to blast my awesome playlist.

00:00:59.958 --> 00:01:02.917
Becca! I didn't know
you were helping with this.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.208
Yeah, well,, it's a pretty big deal,
I guess.

00:01:05.292 --> 00:01:07.708
-So, you know, why not?
-Wow, Tom!

00:01:07.792 --> 00:01:12.083
This really is gonna be
the best dance of all time.

00:01:12.583 --> 00:01:13.958
-But it wasn't.
-[screaming]

00:01:14.042 --> 00:01:15.750
It was actually the worst night

00:01:15.833 --> 00:01:17.625
-of my life!
-[bang]

00:01:25.917 --> 00:01:27.958
[cheering]

00:01:32.708 --> 00:01:35.458
[Angela] I was getting party snacks
with Ben

00:01:35.542 --> 00:01:38.583
when everything
started to go terribly wrong.

00:01:38.667 --> 00:01:42.750
This is gonna be the coldest,
most romantic night of the year.

00:01:42.833 --> 00:01:45.167
-[cell dialing]
-It's just gonna be cold for me.

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:47.250
Xenon won't answer my calls.

00:01:47.333 --> 00:01:50.500
Ben, I'm sure she's coming.
She's not gonna ditch you.

00:01:50.583 --> 00:01:53.792
-What?
-[Ben] Hi, Xenon. It's me again.

00:01:53.875 --> 00:01:55.208
Weird.

00:01:55.292 --> 00:01:57.292
Why is Becca giggling at Tom?

00:01:57.375 --> 00:02:02.250
And since when does she wear
super cute flirt-with-me boots?

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:08.958
[Angela] It looked bad.

00:02:09.042 --> 00:02:11.542
But I was sure Becca
would have an explanation.

00:02:11.625 --> 00:02:13.875
-[cell phone ringing]
-Hey, Angela.

00:02:13.958 --> 00:02:18.042
Oh, hi, my gal pal. What are you up to?

00:02:18.125 --> 00:02:20.708
Uh, buying party supplies with Hank.

00:02:20.792 --> 00:02:22.833
Oh, with Hank, huh?

00:02:23.375 --> 00:02:26.000
Yeah. He's, um, kind of cool.

00:02:26.083 --> 00:02:28.458
Okay. Well, have fun Hanking out.

00:02:28.542 --> 00:02:31.125
That's what we say
when we hang out with Hank.

00:02:31.208 --> 00:02:33.292
But you already know that, so...

00:02:33.375 --> 00:02:35.250
see you later, friend!

00:02:35.333 --> 00:02:36.458
Grrr!

00:02:36.542 --> 00:02:38.250
[humming

00:02:40.375 --> 00:02:42.042
Woo! Whoa!

00:02:42.125 --> 00:02:43.667
Argh!

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:45.917
I really think
we should do my hockey idea.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.208
Ginger, the town's counting on us
to make this a special night.

00:02:49.292 --> 00:02:53.083
The Flamingos are welcome to come,
but only if they wanna get funky.

00:02:53.167 --> 00:02:55.125
[funky music playing]

00:02:57.292 --> 00:02:58.792
Bleurgh!

00:02:58.875 --> 00:03:00.958
You need to stay away from Becca!

00:03:01.042 --> 00:03:02.917
What? Wh-- Why?

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.917
-Becca and I are just friends.
-[fake laughter]

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.542
You are so naïve, it's cute.

00:03:08.625 --> 00:03:11.458
She is trying to steal you away from me,

00:03:11.542 --> 00:03:14.125
and she's using the dance... Argh!

00:03:14.208 --> 00:03:15.708
...to do it! So...

00:03:15.792 --> 00:03:16.958
whaddya say?

00:03:17.042 --> 00:03:19.292
Should we ban her from the dance?

00:03:19.375 --> 00:03:20.958
[gasps] No!

00:03:21.042 --> 00:03:22.958
The dance is for everyone.

00:03:23.042 --> 00:03:24.917
-But... Oh!
-Argh!

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.333
-If she's going, I don't want to!
-[groans]

00:03:27.417 --> 00:03:28.625
Angela, wait!

00:03:28.708 --> 00:03:30.417
You're not making sense.

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:32.375
We can be friends with other people.

00:03:32.458 --> 00:03:36.708
Well... then...
consider yourself dateless!

00:03:36.792 --> 00:03:39.167
[screams]

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:40.292

00:03:41.583 --> 00:03:42.583
[sighs]

00:03:42.667 --> 00:03:45.000
[Angela] I decided
instead of a dance party,

00:03:45.083 --> 00:03:46.417
I would have a pity party.

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:47.667
[slurps]

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:49.958
And no one was invited but me.

00:03:50.625 --> 00:03:52.000
Hey, what's wrong, kiddo?

00:03:52.083 --> 00:03:55.250
The double berry smoothie
usually makes everyone smile.

00:03:55.333 --> 00:03:58.333
-Did I use too much pepper?
-It's not the smoothie.

00:03:58.417 --> 00:03:59.875
It's Tom.

00:03:59.958 --> 00:04:02.708
I uninvited myself from the Snow Ball

00:04:02.792 --> 00:04:05.917
because he's spending too much time
with another girl.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.208
Oh,. I don't know nothin' about that.

00:04:08.292 --> 00:04:09.625
Maybe take a bubble bath.

00:04:09.708 --> 00:04:12.375
I hear you multi-celled organisms
like bubble baths.

00:04:12.458 --> 00:04:16.542
She can't just sit in soapy water
like a dirty dish!

00:04:16.625 --> 00:04:20.042
Listen. If someone wants
to steal your boy,

00:04:20.125 --> 00:04:21.708
you gotta fight back!

00:04:21.792 --> 00:04:23.625
But I tried to fight back.

00:04:23.708 --> 00:04:26.042
By crying in your fruit drink?

00:04:26.125 --> 00:04:27.250
That's pathetic!

00:04:27.333 --> 00:04:31.292
You've gotta make Tom realize
what a big mistake he's made.

00:04:31.875 --> 00:04:33.375
Let me see...

00:04:34.792 --> 00:04:36.125
A little of this...

00:04:36.208 --> 00:04:39.833
a lot of that... How about some of this?

00:04:39.917 --> 00:04:41.583
Oh, yes!

00:04:42.125 --> 00:04:45.333
Wow! Angela, you are one hot potato.

00:04:45.417 --> 00:04:47.125
That's just step one.

00:04:47.208 --> 00:04:48.875
Here's step two.

00:04:48.958 --> 00:04:51.875
You show up to the dance
with another date.

00:04:51.958 --> 00:04:54.667
What? I don't know, Rhonda.

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:58.792
Trust me.
If Tom thinks he's about to lose you,

00:04:58.875 --> 00:05:01.167
he'll be putty in your hands.

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:02.833
So, look around.

00:05:02.917 --> 00:05:06.333
What lucky guy is gonna be your fake date?

00:05:18.833 --> 00:05:20.333
That's my guy.

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:36.667
It's okay, Tom.
You're not the only one without a date.

are going it alone. See?

[chatter and whooping]

00:05:43.292 --> 00:05:47.083
I just can't believe Angela ditched me
because of this Becca thing,

00:05:47.167 --> 00:05:49.583
which, by the way, is not a thing.

00:05:49.667 --> 00:05:52.458
I know. Becca is just a friend...

00:05:52.542 --> 00:05:55.458
who happens to be currently
making an ice heart

00:05:55.542 --> 00:05:57.000

Wait... is this Becca thing... a thing?

-Maybe I should call Angela.

Fine. You know what? I don't care!

00:06:32.292 --> 00:06:35.167
Angela is obviously
just trying to make me jealous.

00:06:35.250 --> 00:06:38.042
[Hank] She certainly picked
the right guy for that.

00:06:38.125 --> 00:06:40.625
See his moves? He can hop and bop!

00:06:40.708 --> 00:06:42.333
I'll hop and bop too.

No, you!

00:08:08.167 --> 00:08:10.833
I have had a crush on you
ever since we first met.

00:08:11.333 --> 00:08:14.000
I set up the DJ booth
and I filled the playlist

with TV theme songs,
your favorite kind of music.

but Tom kept getting in the way
as I tried to get your attention.

so I could ask if you had a girlfriend,

but then you showed up.

you were hanging out with Hank...

That's what I was doing.

I guess she has a thing for guys
covered in potato chip crumbs.

00:09:36.125 --> 00:09:37.750
Becca, I am so sorry.

00:09:37.833 --> 00:09:40.583
I should have never assumed
you were going after Tom.

00:09:40.667 --> 00:09:44.125
It's okay. I should've been honest
about my Hank feelings.

I was just on a mission
at the bottom of the ocean.

Turns out sharks are as bad as you think.

Now let's boogie!
