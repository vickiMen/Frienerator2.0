00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.958
[sentimental music playing]

00:00:11.917 --> 00:00:13.667
[beeping]

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:15.542
[sighs] I know, bracelet.

00:00:15.625 --> 00:00:17.542
I'm banned from doing tech.

00:00:17.625 --> 00:00:21.500
I just like to look back sometimes and
remember what this garage was like

00:00:21.583 --> 00:00:24.292
when it was full of amazing science.

00:00:24.375 --> 00:00:26.125
[rumbling]

00:00:26.958 --> 00:00:30.542
What in the name of the cosmos
is going on out here?

00:00:30.625 --> 00:00:32.875
-[Tom] Check it out.
-Ohh!

00:00:32.958 --> 00:00:36.333
I won a contest
where the prize is going to space

00:00:36.417 --> 00:00:38.375
to write my name on the sun!

00:00:38.458 --> 00:00:40.125
-[Ben gasps]
-[Tom] Goes to show,

00:00:40.208 --> 00:00:42.292
if you mail in enough cereal box tops,

00:00:42.375 --> 00:00:43.750
good things can happen.

00:00:43.833 --> 00:00:48.083
Yeah, I won a yoyo that way once.
Welcome to the victory club, buddy!

00:00:50.375 --> 00:00:52.417
-Ohh!
-Is this really something

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.333
a contest can give away?
The sun belongs to everybody.

00:00:55.417 --> 00:00:57.667
Angela, don't get caught up
in the details.

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.375
What's important is... that is a spaceship

00:01:00.458 --> 00:01:02.417
and I am going in it.

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:05.833
Tom, take me with you!
Please, please, please, please, please,

00:01:05.917 --> 00:01:07.125
please, please, please !

00:01:07.208 --> 00:01:09.542
[sighs] Here.

00:01:09.625 --> 00:01:11.167
You can borrow my special new

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:12.917
-high-tech astronaut watch.
-Yeah!

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:14.583
Which I also won.

00:01:15.375 --> 00:01:18.292
-Man, this is a good contest!
-Wow!

00:01:24.375 --> 00:01:26.833
[Angela] Tom, be careful out there!

00:01:26.917 --> 00:01:29.625
I'll be fine. It's only space.

00:01:29.708 --> 00:01:31.458
[engines whoosh]

00:01:33.083 --> 00:01:34.417
[screams]

00:01:36.417 --> 00:01:38.833
[Tom] Woo-hoo!

00:01:38.917 --> 00:01:41.917
[sighs] Well, he's having a nice Thursday.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.250
-[beeping]
-[all gasp]

00:01:43.333 --> 00:01:45.458
Why is my watch beeping?

00:01:46.167 --> 00:01:47.792
Hello, Tom!

00:01:47.875 --> 00:01:49.250
[all] The CEO?

00:01:49.333 --> 00:01:51.750
Wait, you're not Tom.
Did I call the wrong watch?

00:01:51.833 --> 00:01:56.333
No! I borrowed this from Tom
because he went to stupid space!

00:01:56.417 --> 00:01:58.583
He did? He really fell for it?

00:01:58.667 --> 00:02:00.167
Yes. Apparently he...

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:02.333
Wait. Fell for it?

00:02:02.417 --> 00:02:03.917
What's going on?

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:05.333
Oh, not much.

00:02:05.417 --> 00:02:09.375
Except I set up a fake contest
and tricked Tom into thinking he won it.

00:02:09.458 --> 00:02:14.833
I just blasted my greatest enemy off this
planet forever! What a wonderful Thursday!

00:02:14.958 --> 00:02:17.167
[evil laughter]

00:02:25.458 --> 00:02:27.500
[cheering]

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:35.208
You bring my boyfriend back
right now, CEO!

00:02:35.292 --> 00:02:36.500
Why would I do that?

00:02:36.583 --> 00:02:39.917
With Tom gone, I'm finally free
to do whatever business I want.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.042
I could make a mind-control TV.

00:02:42.125 --> 00:02:45.042
Or make food only available
to people who work for me!

00:02:45.125 --> 00:02:47.958
I should write this down.
I'm burning through ideas.

00:02:48.042 --> 00:02:50.292
Grrr! He cannot get away with this!

00:02:50.375 --> 00:02:52.417
We have to save Tom!

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:54.708
Right, and I know how to do it.

00:02:55.625 --> 00:02:59.625
Mmm! I'll construct a satellite
to find Tom

00:02:59.708 --> 00:03:02.750
and then connect it to a magnetic lasso.

00:03:02.833 --> 00:03:04.125
Technology can...

00:03:04.208 --> 00:03:06.167
-[zapping]
-Aaarrrgh!

00:03:07.792 --> 00:03:09.333
[groans]

00:03:09.417 --> 00:03:14.125
Oh, right. My anti-tech bracelet
is gonna be a problem here.

00:03:14.208 --> 00:03:16.375
How did you not get rid of that thing
by now?

00:03:16.458 --> 00:03:18.958
I tried! It can't be removed.

00:03:19.042 --> 00:03:22.417
But if the bracelet won't let Ben
make the Tom-saving machine,

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:23.792
does that mean Tom...

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:26.708
-can't be saved?
-[Angela roars]

00:03:27.292 --> 00:03:29.375
-You're just jewelry!
-[frantic beeping]

00:03:29.458 --> 00:03:31.917
Jewelry is supposed to
make the world better!

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:33.333
-[zapping]
-[screams]

00:03:34.875 --> 00:03:37.542
-[beeping laughter]
-What are you doing?

00:03:37.625 --> 00:03:40.042
Too bad we can't make friends
with the bracelet.

00:03:40.125 --> 00:03:44.125
Then it would understand how important
it was to save our other friend.

00:03:44.208 --> 00:03:46.458
-[gasps]
-But you must've already tried that.

00:03:46.542 --> 00:03:49.625
Sorry for bringing up an idea
you already tried, everybody.

00:03:49.708 --> 00:03:51.958
Actually... we haven't tried that idea.

00:03:52.042 --> 00:03:55.250
Hmm. Maybe instead of
fighting the bracelet,

00:03:55.333 --> 00:03:57.458
we should become friends with it.

00:03:57.542 --> 00:03:59.833
Let's do it. But we have to hurry.

00:03:59.917 --> 00:04:02.125
Tom must be so scared right now.

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:08.458
Woo-hoo!

00:04:08.542 --> 00:04:09.958
Yeah! [laughs]

00:04:10.042 --> 00:04:12.000
-[camera shutter clicking]
-[laughter]

00:04:13.167 --> 00:04:17.208
Oh, yeah.
This is profile pic material, for sure!

00:04:17.292 --> 00:04:19.125
Woo! Working up a sweat.

00:04:19.208 --> 00:04:20.917
Didn't know space was so warm.

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:30.958
Okay, bracelet, let's get friendly.

00:04:31.042 --> 00:04:33.542
First thing to know
about being a friend is,

00:04:33.625 --> 00:04:36.333
friends play games together.
I'm gonna kick this ball

00:04:36.417 --> 00:04:38.250
-and you try to block it.
-[beeping]

00:04:38.917 --> 00:04:41.250
-Ready?
-[beeping]

00:04:43.042 --> 00:04:44.042
Ow!

00:04:46.042 --> 00:04:47.208
[all] Aww!

00:04:47.292 --> 00:04:48.667
That's not very friendly!

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:50.250
[beeping laughter]

00:04:52.083 --> 00:04:55.083
When I think of friends,
I think of makeovers.

00:04:55.167 --> 00:04:58.583
Bracelet, get ready
for a friendship makeover.

00:04:59.333 --> 00:05:00.917
Oh, that's...

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.792
Mmm. And that is... Okay, and try this.

00:05:03.875 --> 00:05:06.125
Perfect. And... ta-da!

00:05:07.083 --> 00:05:08.833
-[all] Wow!
-[angry beeping]

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:12.042
Argh! What?

00:05:12.125 --> 00:05:13.958
-Huh?
-Ooh!

00:05:14.042 --> 00:05:15.042
D'oh!

00:05:15.125 --> 00:05:18.542
For me, the best part of friendship
is just being silly together.

00:05:18.625 --> 00:05:21.750
And there's no better place to do that
than a photo booth.

00:05:21.833 --> 00:05:24.375
-[laughter]
-[shutter clicking]

00:05:25.583 --> 00:05:27.083
[squelching]

00:05:27.708 --> 00:05:29.792
-[groaning]
-[bracelet chuckles]

00:05:29.875 --> 00:05:31.667
This is ridiculous!

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:33.250
There must be something...

00:05:33.333 --> 00:05:34.625
Yeeow!

00:05:34.708 --> 00:05:39.083
I don't know if I even wanna be friends
with that thing. That bracelet is a bully.

00:05:39.167 --> 00:05:41.083
Well, we have to do something!

00:05:41.167 --> 00:05:45.708
My astronaut watch says Tom is getting
further and further in space. Look!

00:05:45.792 --> 00:05:47.708
[excited beeping]

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:50.750
[whistling]

00:05:52.833 --> 00:05:54.750
[whistles]

00:05:54.833 --> 00:05:58.458
Wait a minute.
I don't speak evil technology,

00:05:58.542 --> 00:06:00.542
but I know what that sound means.

00:06:00.625 --> 00:06:04.458
Ben's bracelet has a crush
on Ginger's watch!

00:06:04.542 --> 00:06:07.292
[shrieking] What? Ah, come on!

00:06:07.375 --> 00:06:09.083
-Listen up, boys.
-Aww!

00:06:09.167 --> 00:06:11.042
I have a plan.

00:06:13.208 --> 00:06:16.208
-[shutter clicks]
-Look at all this space stuff.

00:06:16.750 --> 00:06:20.333
Oh, I gotta send these pictures to Angela.
She'll be so jealous.

00:06:21.750 --> 00:06:24.958
Uh... Where is the "Call Earth" button?

00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:27.375
-Ah-ha!
-[dull thud]

00:06:27.458 --> 00:06:29.333
-Huh?
-[dull thuds]

00:06:29.875 --> 00:06:31.125
Oh!

00:06:33.250 --> 00:06:35.458
Wait, wait.. Wh-- What is going on?

00:06:35.750 --> 00:06:38.125
Strange, right? [laughs evilly]

00:06:38.208 --> 00:06:40.375
CEO? What are you doing here?

00:06:40.750 --> 00:06:43.792
I already told your friends,
but I like saying it, so...

00:06:43.875 --> 00:06:46.083
-You didn't win a contest!
-What?

00:06:46.167 --> 00:06:50.625
You got tricked by me.
Now you have to live in space! [cackles]

00:06:50.708 --> 00:06:54.417
You took advantage of my trust
of free things that come in the mail?

00:06:54.500 --> 00:06:56.500
That's low, even for you!

00:06:56.583 --> 00:07:01.042
Maybe, but it all worked out perfectly.
Except you gave away your fancy watch,

00:07:01.125 --> 00:07:03.792
so I had to come out here
and mark you in person.

00:07:03.875 --> 00:07:06.458
Still, that's not going to
mess up my plan.

00:07:06.542 --> 00:07:08.208
Yeah, well, that's what you think!

00:07:08.292 --> 00:07:10.625
I'm coming over there
to take over your ship.

00:07:13.958 --> 00:07:16.042
[cackles]

00:07:16.125 --> 00:07:18.917
Oh, my, that didn't help you at all.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:22.625
You just pointed yourself
directly at the sun. [cackles]

00:07:22.708 --> 00:07:23.958
[Tom] Oh, no!

00:07:26.667 --> 00:07:30.208
-[romantic music playing]
-[flirtatious beeping]

00:07:31.167 --> 00:07:33.125
I really don't like this, guys.

00:07:33.958 --> 00:07:37.042
Quiet, Ginger. This isn't about you.
It's about your watch.

00:07:37.125 --> 00:07:39.958
Are they hitting it off?
Whaddya think, Angela?

00:07:40.042 --> 00:07:42.875
I'm not sure, but it's time to find out.

00:07:42.958 --> 00:07:45.042
-Ginger!
-Huh!

00:07:45.667 --> 00:07:47.958
I had a lot of fun
being friends with you.

00:07:48.042 --> 00:07:51.250
But I have to go home now
so I can move to another country.

00:07:51.333 --> 00:07:52.667
Nice knowing you.

00:07:52.750 --> 00:07:55.125
Ginger! Surely we'll see you again?

00:07:55.208 --> 00:07:58.958
Nope. This is the last time
you'll ever see me, or any of my things.

00:07:59.042 --> 00:08:00.583
Like my bike, or my helmet,

00:08:00.667 --> 00:08:02.583
or my cool astronaut watch.

00:08:02.833 --> 00:08:05.083
[mournful beeping]

00:08:05.917 --> 00:08:07.833
I know, bracelet, it's sad.

00:08:07.917 --> 00:08:10.958
Move on. You and the watch
are from two different worlds.

00:08:11.042 --> 00:08:12.167
He's right.

00:08:12.250 --> 00:08:15.917
The only way you could be with that watch
was if you got off my wrist.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:17.458
So what can you do?

00:08:18.208 --> 00:08:20.667
[rapid beeping]

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:36.958
-Aw!
-Eugh!

00:08:39.667 --> 00:08:42.042
Goodbye, friend.

00:08:42.125 --> 00:08:43.250
[stutters]

00:08:43.333 --> 00:08:45.583
That thing can...

00:08:46.417 --> 00:08:47.500
talk?

00:08:48.625 --> 00:08:51.667
Yeah, we did it. Now get inventing.
Go, go, go!

00:08:52.542 --> 00:08:56.458
QWERTY, U, I, O, P, left bracket,
right bracket...

00:08:56.542 --> 00:08:58.875
We're backslash, baby!

00:08:59.958 --> 00:09:02.292
-Oh...
-Okay, Tom.

00:09:02.375 --> 00:09:07.208
It's been nice knowing you, but this is
as close to the sun as I'm willing to get.

00:09:07.292 --> 00:09:09.708
I'm sweating through my suit.

00:09:15.208 --> 00:09:16.375
[sighs deeply]

00:09:17.042 --> 00:09:18.625
I'm sorry, Angela.

00:09:21.458 --> 00:09:23.417
I always knew I'd go out like this.

00:09:28.375 --> 00:09:29.375
[ragged breath]

00:09:29.458 --> 00:09:31.292
[clang]

00:09:32.083 --> 00:09:33.375
Hey, Tom!

00:09:34.083 --> 00:09:35.917
Ben, is that you?

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.292
We thought you could use some help.

00:09:45.458 --> 00:09:47.958
What's going on? It's not fair!

00:09:48.042 --> 00:09:52.000
Noooooooo!

00:09:52.833 --> 00:09:54.750
[grunting with effort]

00:09:55.792 --> 00:09:58.542
Keep cranking! We've got him!

00:09:58.625 --> 00:09:59.750
[Angela yells]

00:10:01.917 --> 00:10:03.667
Wait! What happened?

00:10:03.750 --> 00:10:04.875
Did we lose him?

00:10:08.875 --> 00:10:09.917
Argh!

00:10:18.875 --> 00:10:19.875
No!

00:10:20.250 --> 00:10:21.250
Tom?

00:10:23.083 --> 00:10:25.000

-Tom!

00:10:26.875 --> 00:10:28.875
Oh, it's so good to see you again!

00:10:28.958 --> 00:10:31.167
It's good to see you too.
But I don't get it.

00:10:31.250 --> 00:10:34.167
Who built this machine?
I know it couldn't have been Ben.

00:10:34.250 --> 00:10:37.208
It sure could have been. And it was!

00:10:37.292 --> 00:10:39.958
All it took was my amazing science genius

00:10:40.042 --> 00:10:42.375
and a bit of friendship.

00:10:42.458 --> 00:10:46.417
-[Tom] Nice! No bracelet.
