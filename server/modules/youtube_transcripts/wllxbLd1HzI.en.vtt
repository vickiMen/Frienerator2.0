 however they arrived very late and 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:34.620
 now try to make up an excuse for 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:36.840
 justify the delay 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.989

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.989

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:06.260

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:33.890

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:39.409
 sorry sir tall is one was praised 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:41.330
 quite common in the English language and may have 

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:42.290
 different meanings depending on the 

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:45.020
 context 

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:47.690
 in this room follow the discharge was used 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:50.119
 in the sense of finding out 

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:53.800
 determine a solution after you have 

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:57.410
 thought of the subject for example the 

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:58.009
 former champion who passed away Geraldo motta each 

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:59.780
 base 

00:01:58.009 --> 00:02:02.149
 after spending an hour trying 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:04.550
 fix his computer they 

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:08.179
 finally figured out what the problem was 

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:10.550
 sometimes will follow high can mean 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:12.860
 simply understand when we 

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:17.600
 we refer to someone's behavior by 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:18.590
 example said instead because she always 

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:20.720
 do it 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:23.989
 I can not understand as to the 

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:27.530
 pronunciation notice coming out uncle here was 

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:30.140
 pronounced as spain china what is 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:36.950
 very common in english spoken the word 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:41.030
 following has only two syllables follows the 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:48.380
 letter is not pronounced and rsi ao uol 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:52.060
 in general general the letter t in high 

00:02:48.380 --> 00:03:03.980
 tension of rn in Portuguese and the word is 

00:02:52.060 --> 00:03:07.549
 reduced to walk in the ex-west word 

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:13.609
 nal is not pronounced and oeci tension ds 

00:03:07.549 --> 00:03:16.640
 even because the word here is a 

00:03:13.609 --> 00:03:21.709
 noun I draw attention to this 

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:22.880
 the verb as in team which means with 

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:27.370
 license 

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:27.370
 this is a duty 

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:52.159
 so we have three pounds 

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:56.159
 china iran and his guard john authers 

00:03:52.159 --> 00:03:58.590
 mark all the father of the ace at the time iran 

00:03:56.159 --> 00:04:01.349
 how about that we can say that 

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:01.920
 mark told us five o'clock not four 

00:04:01.349 --> 00:04:04.200
 hours 

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:06.540
 this way we are just in time you 

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:08.910
 you should remember that baltic thinning is a 

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:11.700
 expression used to introduce 

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:14.640
 a suggestion and is equivalent to ours how about 

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:15.390
 for example idol and the map 

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:17.340
 fashion 

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:21.989
 i know you don't eat pork 

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:24.810
 what such a fish means at the time 

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:28.139
 and here the word haiti was used 

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:31.800
 to emphasize this team means in 

00:04:28.139 --> 00:04:34.260
 time means well on time 

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:37.380
 It is also worth mentioning that the team has 

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:40.229
 a different use of joining the team 

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:42.479
 means in time ie within the 

00:04:40.229 --> 00:04:44.789
 term for example if you have to catch 

00:04:42.479 --> 00:04:48.389
 the bus that will leave at five 

00:04:44.789 --> 00:04:51.240

00:04:53.669 --> 00:05:00.510

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:07.800

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:25.949

00:05:25.949 --> 00:05:38.910
 l is not pronounced 

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:41.820
 this word is well reduced in the word a 

00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:49.139

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:52.229

00:07:28.349 --> 00:07:35.000

 followed by a word starting with 

00:08:08.100 --> 00:08:11.460
 a vowel 

00:08:09.300 --> 00:08:18.840
