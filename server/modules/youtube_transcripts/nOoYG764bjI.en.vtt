00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.625
[both humming]

00:00:04.708 --> 00:00:07.917
Well, we are finally going to be
where we belong,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.708
hobnobbing with the fancy people
at the Change the Children charity gala.

00:00:11.792 --> 00:00:14.833
I don't know why I have to go.
You're the mayor, not me.

00:00:14.917 --> 00:00:18.125
Well, this party is a huge opportunity
to meet important people

00:00:18.208 --> 00:00:20.500
-and show off our inventions.
-But what if I don't fit in?

00:00:20.583 --> 00:00:23.583
What if I eat wrong
then they throw little pickles at me?

00:00:23.667 --> 00:00:25.458
-Oh!
-[gasps]

00:00:31.708 --> 00:00:33.292
[Tom] Wow!

00:00:38.458 --> 00:00:41.250
Angela, you look like
a French Christmas present.

00:00:41.333 --> 00:00:45.042
Thanks! I didn't have anything formal,
so I just put bows on an old dress.

00:00:45.125 --> 00:00:48.542
I'm Mayor Tom,
and I approve of those bows.

00:00:48.625 --> 00:00:51.833
Just look at us!
We have come so far.

00:00:51.917 --> 00:00:54.458
So, you guys got dressed up, too?

00:00:54.542 --> 00:00:58.458
Yep. This baby is from back in the day
when I was working as a bow-tie model.

00:00:58.542 --> 00:01:01.750
Funny story. I went in thinking
they were looking for a glow-tie model--

00:01:01.833 --> 00:01:03.792
Hank! I just don't know.

00:01:03.875 --> 00:01:07.333
You guys probably won't be comfortable
brushing elbows with fancy people.

00:01:07.417 --> 00:01:11.833
Yes, we would. Look!
We're already wearing elbow brushes.

00:01:11.917 --> 00:01:15.792
Not to be mean, but you guys are
too immature and silly for a fancy party.

00:01:15.875 --> 00:01:17.208
You'll embarrass us.

00:01:17.292 --> 00:01:22.042
You're immature and silly, Tom,
and your butt will embarrass us!

00:01:23.125 --> 00:01:24.750
-Mm-hm!
-Why aren't they going?

00:01:24.833 --> 00:01:27.458
-Can they take my spot?
-No. Now, keep this thing on.

00:01:27.542 --> 00:01:29.833
You look like a common garage person
without it.

00:01:29.917 --> 00:01:32.292
Fancy parties really change people.

00:01:32.375 --> 00:01:35.375
Looks like I wore my glow tie for nothing.

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:43.542
♪ Wa-oah ♪

00:01:52.167 --> 00:01:55.708
-[hum of conversation, lounge music]
-Wow! Look at this place!

00:01:55.792 --> 00:01:59.250
-Time to mingle with the fancy folk.
-I'm great at mingling.

00:01:59.333 --> 00:02:04.000
And I'm good at standing perfectly still
and just hoping that nobody notices me.

00:02:04.083 --> 00:02:07.292
No, Ben. You're at this charity event
for one reason.

00:02:07.375 --> 00:02:09.542
Everyone,
go find a rich person to impress.

00:02:09.625 --> 00:02:12.042
You know, for the children!

00:02:12.125 --> 00:02:14.542
Hey! Do I look like I work here?

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:17.625
And the answer is yes. Yes, I do.

00:02:17.708 --> 00:02:20.917
Serving girl,
direct me to the cheese plates.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.958
[gasps] Autumn Summers? My old nemesis.

00:02:25.042 --> 00:02:27.583
-It's a neck-tacula.
-I know what I said!

00:02:27.667 --> 00:02:31.500
Autumn Summers, you know what?
We don't want to sell our scarves here.

00:02:31.583 --> 00:02:34.792
You'll never warm a neck again!

00:02:35.875 --> 00:02:38.042
All right, Angela. Snap back into it.

00:02:38.125 --> 00:02:40.958
I am here to mingle, small-talk, and not--

00:02:41.042 --> 00:02:43.542
No, but-- You-- Huh.

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:48.542
Well, hello, there. I'm Tom - Mayor Tom.

00:02:48.625 --> 00:02:52.708
-I'm Rich.
-Ha-ha! Yes, I can tell you are!

00:02:52.792 --> 00:02:55.750
No, Rich is my name. Rich Guy.

00:02:55.833 --> 00:02:57.792
Wha-- What are you doing?

00:02:57.875 --> 00:03:01.250
-You've never seen a wishing shredder?
-Oh, I get it.

00:03:01.333 --> 00:03:06.333
-It's like an expensive wishing well.
-Aw. First time using one?

00:03:06.417 --> 00:03:08.208
Of course not! No, no.

00:03:08.292 --> 00:03:11.125
I-I completely fit in here. Are you
impressed? Because you should be.

00:03:11.208 --> 00:03:15.542
[clears throat]
Uh, it seems I only have a one.

00:03:15.625 --> 00:03:18.292
Care to get more money
to make a proper wish?

00:03:18.375 --> 00:03:21.208
No, no, no. A onesie wish will have to do.

00:03:23.083 --> 00:03:25.208
[laughs nervously]

00:03:26.792 --> 00:03:31.542
Um, remind me,
how exactly does this help the charity?

00:03:31.625 --> 00:03:35.042
If you have to ask,
you probably don't belong at this party.

00:03:35.125 --> 00:03:36.958
Uh... He--

00:03:37.042 --> 00:03:38.583
Agh!

00:03:39.667 --> 00:03:42.792
Uh. Tom wants me to mingle, but how?

00:03:42.875 --> 00:03:46.333
All I know is facts, and that never helps
anyone in any social situation.

00:03:46.417 --> 00:03:49.792
Oh! So many cheeses!

00:03:49.875 --> 00:03:51.875
But which do I eat first?

00:03:51.958 --> 00:03:55.333
Hehe. Looks like she could use
some cheese facts, actually.

00:03:55.417 --> 00:03:58.750
No, Ben. Cheese facts are not for parties!

00:03:58.833 --> 00:04:02.000
-I suppose I'll choose at random.
-Random?

00:04:02.667 --> 00:04:04.583
No, no, no.

00:04:05.417 --> 00:04:09.708
Wait! The white cheese is the Geschmack
Krieg and the other is the Dag Schkol.

00:04:09.792 --> 00:04:13.500
For the proper experience you have to eat
the Krieg after the Schkol.

00:04:13.583 --> 00:04:17.542
-What did you just say to me?
-Oh, boy. I shouldn't have spoken.

00:04:17.625 --> 00:04:21.292
I'll let myself out through the back,
so I don't cause a scene.

00:04:21.375 --> 00:04:24.917
-[sobbing]
-[whispers] You... are... fantastic!

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.333
Just as I suspect-- What?

00:04:27.417 --> 00:04:31.000
What culture! What class!
What is your name? Hansel? Chretien?

00:04:31.083 --> 00:04:34.542
-It's... Ben.
-Ah, short for Bentucius!

00:04:34.625 --> 00:04:38.667
Well, Bentucius, you must accompany me
to the Expensive Room.

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:41.875
Only the best people are allowed in there.

00:04:41.958 --> 00:04:45.000
-Because it's expensive, you see.
-Ha! Yeah!

00:04:46.083 --> 00:04:49.375
They think they're so cool,
going to that gala!

00:04:49.458 --> 00:04:52.792
I bet if we had a gala,
it'd be way more fancy than theirs!

00:04:52.875 --> 00:04:56.792
I agree 102%!
The 2% is extra fanciness.

00:04:56.875 --> 00:04:59.833
Everyone at our party
would have fine golden spaghetti.

00:04:59.917 --> 00:05:02.458
And hotdogs wrapped in silk buns.

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:05.667
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:07.792
-Fancy party!
-Yeah!

00:05:07.875 --> 00:05:11.458
-Let's get fancy!
-Woohoo! Yeah!

00:05:13.542 --> 00:05:15.667
Wow! Everything looks so expensive.

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:19.500
Enjoy!
This place is yours, because you fit in.

00:05:19.583 --> 00:05:24.125
Helmut? Ha-ha-ha!
I thought you were at sea!

00:05:24.208 --> 00:05:26.583
Mm-hm. Ah, yes. Mm-hm--

00:05:27.708 --> 00:05:30.958
CEO? I should've known
this was too good to be true.

00:05:31.042 --> 00:05:34.042
What brings you here? Hoping to steal
one of my inventions again?

00:05:34.125 --> 00:05:38.542
What? Ben, please -
this is a children's charity gala.

00:05:38.625 --> 00:05:42.667
Ha, I'm... Sorry. I guess I don't know
all the fancy rules yet.

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:45.583
Still new to the fancy party scene.
So, hi.

00:05:46.375 --> 00:05:48.708
Ben, this event is neutral ground.

00:05:48.792 --> 00:05:51.458
In here, we're both just fancy people.

00:05:51.542 --> 00:05:55.042
I don't even want to know
what your new inventions are.

00:05:55.125 --> 00:05:58.958
Well, that's a relief. Plus, I really
only brought my De-Raisiner.

00:05:59.042 --> 00:06:02.333
-It turns raisins back into grapes.
-Interesting.

00:06:02.417 --> 00:06:04.625
Two foods that have nothing to do
with each other.

00:06:04.708 --> 00:06:08.083
Uh, you do know a raisin is a grape
that's been dried up in the sun, right?

00:06:08.167 --> 00:06:12.292
Um, uh... Of course I do!
Please, no more shop talk.

00:06:12.375 --> 00:06:16.792
Let's put our devices and inventions
in the neutral ground security box

00:06:16.875 --> 00:06:19.083
so we won't be tempted to talk about them.

00:06:19.167 --> 00:06:21.250
What a great idea!

00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:25.875
Well, I'm starting to fit in here,
just like Tom and Angela must be.

00:06:28.292 --> 00:06:31.458
-Ha-ha-ha.
-Ha-ha! Yes! Ha-ha-ha-ha.

00:06:31.542 --> 00:06:34.292
Quite. Ha-ha. Hey.

00:06:38.208 --> 00:06:39.208
Ugh!

00:06:39.792 --> 00:06:43.083
Finally, I meet someone at this party
who knows how to listen!

00:06:43.167 --> 00:06:45.375
So, I was saying--

00:06:45.458 --> 00:06:47.542
-Oh.
-Oh. Ahhh.

00:06:48.625 --> 00:06:52.083
I say, old bean,
fresh coins for your money soup?

00:06:52.875 --> 00:06:57.208
Thanks, my dear fellow.
I like my soup extra rich.

00:06:57.292 --> 00:06:59.500
[affected laughs]

00:06:59.583 --> 00:07:04.000
You know, if this event were
any exclusiver, you wouldn't be here.

00:07:04.083 --> 00:07:06.458
It would just be me,
cause I'm the fanciest.

00:07:06.542 --> 00:07:10.792
Don't be so certain! I own
the Eiffel Tower, the fanciest monument.

00:07:10.875 --> 00:07:13.417
And my underwear is made of pure gold.

00:07:13.500 --> 00:07:16.833
Oh, yeah?
Well I have a ski cabin under the ocean!

00:07:16.917 --> 00:07:20.542
And my underwear
is made of golden diamonds!

00:07:20.625 --> 00:07:22.333
This is an outrage!

00:07:22.417 --> 00:07:25.917
I challenge you to a duel,
because even my fights are fancy.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:27.958
Name a time and a place!

00:07:28.042 --> 00:07:32.167
-Very well! Soon and here.
-It is on.

00:07:33.250 --> 00:07:37.000
Well, I find that the facts often do aid
in certain social situations.

00:07:37.083 --> 00:07:40.000
According to
the Wilkinson mingling coefficient,

00:07:40.083 --> 00:07:42.833
it actually is beneficial 84% of the time.

00:07:42.917 --> 00:07:44.000
[laughter]

00:07:46.167 --> 00:07:47.667
Something to chew on.

00:07:47.750 --> 00:07:51.917
Speaking of chewing, where's that waitress
who keeps saying she's not a waitress?

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.833
I'm not a waitress!
See what I'm dealing with?

00:07:54.917 --> 00:07:57.250
Yeah. I'm sorry you're having
such a bad time.

00:07:57.333 --> 00:07:59.917
I'm fitting in really well
with the rich people,

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.625
but if it makes you happy,
we can get Ben and go.

00:08:02.708 --> 00:08:04.375
Psst! Ben, let's go.

00:08:04.458 --> 00:08:08.292
What are you talking about, Tom? This is
going really well. I'm in my element.

00:08:08.375 --> 00:08:11.458
-One of which is barium.
-[laughter]

00:08:11.542 --> 00:08:15.667
Yeah, well, Angela's not having
the awesome time that both of us are,

00:08:15.750 --> 00:08:17.208
so maybe we should bounce.

00:08:17.292 --> 00:08:20.292
I don't want to leave.
I'm meeting people I like.

00:08:20.375 --> 00:08:24.417
Maybe it'll be good for the company.
The CEO and I even had a nice chat.

00:08:24.500 --> 00:08:26.417
-I think we're buddies now.
-All right!

00:08:26.500 --> 00:08:29.500
-Introducing the De-Raisiner!
-What?

00:08:29.583 --> 00:08:32.792
It's a big game-changer, and all my idea.

00:08:32.875 --> 00:08:34.333
Uh-oh.

00:08:34.417 --> 00:08:37.542
This baby will end
all your raisin-related troubles

00:08:37.625 --> 00:08:39.833
-by turning them back into grapes!
-[gasps]

00:08:39.917 --> 00:08:43.500
-Which, did you know, they used to be?
-But, neutral ground.

00:08:43.583 --> 00:08:45.833
-Hey! That's our invention!
-[gasps]

00:08:45.917 --> 00:08:51.125
Oh, yeah? Then why did I just pull it out
from my CEO Inventions Box?

00:08:52.708 --> 00:08:57.042
The neutral ground security box!
Everything at this party is a lie!

00:08:57.125 --> 00:09:02.333
I'm so hurt that you would accuse me
of stealing my own invention.

00:09:02.417 --> 00:09:04.417
I guess you'll have to choose.

00:09:04.500 --> 00:09:07.542
Do you believe me, the rich CEO,

00:09:07.625 --> 00:09:10.417
or the new, not rich guy?

00:09:10.500 --> 00:09:15.042
-[murmuring]
-We, the rich, believe you, Carl.

00:09:15.125 --> 00:09:17.208
You're rich, like us.

00:09:17.292 --> 00:09:20.042
Bentucius, you leave us no choice.

00:09:20.125 --> 00:09:22.792
-Security!
-I got this, Ben.

00:09:22.875 --> 00:09:24.958
-[clamor of voices]
-People, calm down!

00:09:25.042 --> 00:09:28.792
As your Mayor,
I just want to say one thing.

00:09:29.958 --> 00:09:33.333
-Run!
-That's mine! That's my De-Raisiner!

00:09:33.417 --> 00:09:36.917
Come back! My idea! My invention!

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:38.167
[Ginger laughing]

00:09:38.250 --> 00:09:39.917
-Ha-ha-ha!
-No!

00:09:41.750 --> 00:09:46.208
I have a mechanical chicken!
And it lays fancy omelets.

00:09:46.292 --> 00:09:48.500
Grr! Duel!

00:09:48.583 --> 00:09:52.125
Well, I have a golden monster truck
that has its own pancake chef!

00:09:52.208 --> 00:09:54.375
-It's a monster food truck! Duel!
-Aagh!

00:09:55.542 --> 00:09:59.000
Hey, what is going on?
-We're having a fancy party of our own!

00:09:59.083 --> 00:10:00.500
Without you!

00:10:01.292 --> 00:10:03.542
-Oh, hey, Tom. How was your gala?
-Ugh!

00:10:03.625 --> 00:10:06.750
-It was amazing.
-It was awful.

00:10:06.833 --> 00:10:09.875
-Awfully amazing.
-Amazingly awful.

00:10:09.958 --> 00:10:11.833
Yeah, okay, fine. It was horrible.

00:10:11.917 --> 00:10:14.208
Turns out "fancy" just means snobby.

00:10:14.292 --> 00:10:18.417
And the CEO tried to steal
my De-Raisiner - on neutral ground.

00:10:18.500 --> 00:10:22.958
-So, our party is better?
-Way better.

00:10:23.042 --> 00:10:26.375
-Can we, uh, join your party?

00:10:36.458 --> 00:10:37.542
