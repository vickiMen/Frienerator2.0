00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:09.000
 Happy Birthday! 

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:14.040
 Reich, what are you doing? 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:14.100
 It's your birthday! Reich, what are you doing? 

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:15.240
 It's your birthday! 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:18.420
 Hey... 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:21.420
 She is not as pretty as she was at 29! 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:26.020
 Mrs. Green wants to set a series of rules before she leaves. 

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:31.020
 Please do not say the words “old” or “advanced” 

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:36.020
 or "they still look pretty damn attractive!" 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:38.020
 But it is so! 

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:41.020
 Rachel, come on out! 

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:43.020
 Monica cooked breakfast 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.020
 thin chocolate pancakes! 

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:47.020
 We have GIFTS! 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.020
 Good ones? 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:55.020
 They are all from the list that you gave us 2 weeks ago. 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:58.220
 And can I take gifts and stay twenty-nine? 

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:02.700
 Well, Rachel, when you turn 30, it's not such a tragedy ... 

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:03.460
 True? 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:03.500
 Did you feel like that when you turned 30? True? 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:06.060
 Did you feel like that when you turned 30? 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:07.100
 Why, Lord, why? 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:08.740
 We had a deal 

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:12.540
 Let others grow old, but not me! 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:17.980
 Guys, is it just me exaggerating? 

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:18.020
 No, Reich, not only you guys, is it just me exaggerating? 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.980
 No, raitch, not only you 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.500
 My 30th birthday wasn't really fun 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.700
 And now Chandler ... 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:32.460
 We are all getting old. Why are you doing this to us ?!
